<p class="ph1">A CHANGE IN THE<br />
CABINET</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SIR&mdash;or to speak more correctly, the Right Honourable
Sir T. Charles Repton, Bart., M.V.O., O.M.,
Warden of the Court of Dowry, a man past middle
age but in the height of industry, sat at breakfast in
his house: a large house overlooking Hyde Park from
the North, close to the corner of the Edgware Road,
and therefore removed by at least a hundred yards
from the graphic representation which marks the
site of the old Permanent Gallows that once stood
at Tyburn.</p>

<p>I have said that he was Warden of the Court of
Dowry, and the reader, if she has any acquaintance
with parliamentary affairs, will remember that at the
time of which I speak, the month of March, 1915,
that post commonly carried with it Cabinet rank.
The experienced in political matters will certainly
induce that he was also in the House of Commons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
He sat there for Pailton, a borough which had been
the last to elect him after previous experiences in
Merionethshire, Kirkby, Bruton, Powkeley and the
Wymp division of Dorset, in which last his somewhat
constrained and cold manner had perhaps led
to his defeat.</p>

<p>It was not his first experience of office, but he
had never stood so high in the Councils of the
Nation, nor had his presence in the Cabinet ever
more weighed with the young and popular Prime
Minister (who was suffering slightly from his left
lung) than at this moment. For though Charles
Repton did not belong by birth to the group of
families from which the Prime Minister had sprung,
he was of those who, as they advance through life,
accumulate an increasing number of clients, of dependents
and of friends who dare not trifle with such
friendships.</p>

<p>In figure he was tall and somewhat lean; he was
clean-shaven; his brilliant white hair was well
groomed; his brown eyes were singularly piercing,
and, in contrast with his head, two thick, very dark
and strongly arched eyebrows emphasized his
expression. He was by persuasion at this time of
his life a Second Day Wycliffite, and had indeed
professed his connection with that body since at least
his fortieth year, before which period in his career he
had permanently resided in a suburb of Leicester, to
which in turn he had removed from Newcastle.</p>

<p>By profession he was, or rather had been, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
solicitor, in which calling he had ever advised those
clients who had the wisdom to accumulate wealth
to leave the investment of it at his discretion,
nor were they disappointed in the regular receipt
of a moderate but secure income calculated at a
reasonable rate; while to those who (for whatever
reason) lay under the necessity of borrowing, he was
ever ready to advance at a somewhat higher rate
such sums as he had at his disposal.</p>

<p>But this humdrum course of professional life could
never satisfy abilities of his calibre. Shortly after
his entry into political life he had undertaken the
management of numerous industrial ventures, several
of which had proved singularly successful, while
those which had been less fortunate came to grief
through the action of others than himself: nay it was
often shown when the winding-up order came that
such risks had attracted but little of his spare cash.</p>

<p>He was that morning in March, 1915, eating an
egg. He had before him a copy of the <i>Times</i>, the
affairs of which newspaper were among his most
valued connections. The moments he could spare
from its perusal were given to the methodical cutting
open of envelopes and the glancing at their contents,&mdash;an
exercise which it was his rule most methodically
to pursue before he permitted his secretary to deal
with the answers. Indeed some one or two of these
missives he put into his pocket to be dealt with at
his private leisure.</p>

<p>He was alone, for his wife&mdash;Maria, Lady Repton&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
commonly affect to come down after he had
left the house; and this, no matter how late divisions
might have kept him upon the previous evening, he
invariably did at the hour of half-past nine. I may
add that he had no children, but could boast no less
than five horses in town and sixteen in the country,
all his own property, and used to drag in the country
I know not how many vehicles; in London three,
each suitable for its own function. Of motor cars he
kept but one, but that large and in colour a very
bright sky-blue. As he had no proficiency in riding,
he did not indulge in that exercise; but he was fond
of golf and was acquainted with all the technical
terms of the game.</p>

<p>To do him justice he was not without means, nay,
he was what many would call wealthy, and the salary
of £5000 to which, amid the enthusiastic cheers of
the Legislature, the Wardenship of the Court of
Dowry had recently been raised was of no great
consequence to his position.</p>

<p>To another, alas! in the vast and heartless city,
such a salary was shortly to mean far more,&mdash;and
<span class="smcap">George Mulross Demaine</span>, upon whom I will not
for the moment linger, would have been even more
benefited in pocket than in status by the handling
of it.</p>

<p>Careless, however, as Sir Charles Repton might be
of a fringe of income obtainable only while his own
Party were in office, it was imagined that he was not
a little attached to other advantages connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his Wardenship. It is doubtful whether a man of
this firm, reticent and dominating character could
really be attached to such accidents of his post as the
carrying of a model ship, bareheaded, in the great
procession upon Empire Day, the wearing upon
state occasions of shoes which curled up at the
toe and were caught back to the ankles by small
silver chains, or the presence upon these ornaments
of several tiny bells that jingled as he walked;
anachronisms of this kind can have produced little
but discomfort in one of his stern mould when,
upon the rare occasions of court functions, he was
compelled to adopt the official dress. But there
was more!</p>

<p>The Wardenship of the Court of Dowry carried
with it something regal in that great world of affairs
in which he moved, and bitter as had been the
attacks upon his colleagues in the Nationalist
Cabinet,&mdash;especially during the futile attempt to
pass the Broadening of the Streets Bill&mdash;Sir Charles
had always been treated with peculiar and exceptional
respect, though he would never have used
methods so underhand as to foreclose upon any
newspaper with whom he might have a political
difference or to embarrass by official action any
considerable advertiser of patent medicines whose
manufacture came under the purview of his Department.</p>

<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that he had
raised one of the minor Government posts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
level of the Foreign Office, but, at any rate, it had
under his reign become almost as prominent as it
had been when GHERKIN had first raised it to the
rank of a principal function in the State. It was one
of the great spending departments; Repton saw to
that.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Repton prepared to leave his house,
I say, at half-past nine; his mind was intent upon
the business of the morning, which was a Board
meeting of the Van Diemens. It need not yet
concern the reader, it is enough for her to know (and
the knowledge is consonant with Repton&#8217;s character)
that the Company was prepared to develop all that
North-eastern littoral of the Australian Continent
for which it had obtained a charter but which no
enterprise had as yet succeeded in bringing into line
with the vast energies of the Empire.</p>

<p>Of the strategical advantages such a position can
give, I need not speak. Luckily they were in the
hands of patriots.</p>

<p>The comparatively small sum of £4,000,000 which
by its charter the Company was permitted to raise
would have been subscribed twenty times over in
the rush for shares seven years before, and it is
common knowledge that at a particular moment
during which values must surely have been inflated,
they reached a premium of between 800 and 900
per cent. The cool process of reflection which
often follows such errors had by this time driven
them if anything too low, and the original one pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
share which had twice all but touched £9, had
been for now many months unsaleable at a nominal
price of 16/3.</p>

<p>There exists a sound rule of public administration
of this country&mdash;inaugurated, I believe, by Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;which forbids a Cabinet Minister to hold
any public directorship at the same time as his official
post, and indeed it is this rule which renders it usual
for a couple of men upon opposite sides of the House
to come to an arrangement whereby the one shall be
Director while his colleague is in office, lest important
commercial affairs should be neglected through the
too rigid application of what is in principle so
excellent a rule. But there had been no necessity
for this arrangement in the case of so great an
Imperial business as the Van Diemens: it touched
too nearly the major interests of the country for its
connection with a Cabinet Minister to be remarkable,
and all patriotic opinion was sincerely glad when,
in the preceding January, Sir Charles Repton had
consented to acquire without direct purchase a few
thousand shares and to take an active part in raising
the fortunes of the scheme.</p>

<p>It was recognised upon all sides that the act was
one of statesman-like self-sacrifice, and there were
perhaps but two papers in London (two evening
papers of large circulation but of no high standing)
which so much as alluded to Sir Charles&#8217; labours in
this field.</p>

<p>Of these one, the <i>Moon</i>, catered especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for that very considerable public which will have
England mistress of the waves, which is interested
in the printed results of horse-racing, which had
formerly triumphantly carried at the polls the demand
for protection, and which was somewhat embittered by
so many years of office during which the Nationalist
Party had done little more than tax the parts of
motor cars, foreign unsweetened prunes, moss litter,
and such small quantities of foreign sulphuric acid
as are used in the manufacture of beer.</p>

<p>The other, the <i>Capon</i>&mdash;to give it its entire name&mdash;was
of a finer stamp. All the young enthusiasts read
it, and it was enormously bought for its Notes on
Gardening, its caricatures, its clever headlines, and
its short, downright little leaders not twenty lines
long, printed, by a successful innovation, in capitals
throughout, and in a red ink that showed up finely
against the plain black and white of the remainder.</p>

<p>Both these papers had continually and violently
attacked the connection of one of our few great
statesmen with the last of the vast enterprises of
Empire. The <i>Capon</i>, whose editor was a young man
with very wild eyes and hair like a weeping willow,
attacked it on principle. The <i>Moon</i>&mdash;whose proprietor
was an intimate friend of Sir Charles&#8217; own&mdash;was
more practical, and attacked the connection
between Repton and the Company with good old
personalities worthy of a more virile age.</p>

<p>Well then, at this hour of half-past nine on that
March day of 1915, Charles Repton rose from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
breakfast. He touched the crumbs upon his waistcoat
so that they fell, and those upon his trousers
also. He looked severely at the footman in the hall,
who quailed a little at that glance, he rapidly put on
his coat unaided, and asked briefly to see the butler.</p>

<p>The butler came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out to lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Parker that if one of my letters is ever left
again on the table after I have gone, I shall speak to
Lady Repton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The car is not to be used on any account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned round abruptly and went down the steps
and into the street, while one of his large footmen
shut the huge door ever so gently behind him.</p>

<p>He was a man of such character, who conducted
his household so firmly, that the man, though now
five months in his service, dared exchange no jest
with the butler who went quietly off to his own part
of the house again. It was a singular proof of what
rigid domestic government can do.</p>

<p>From her room Maria, Lady Repton, when she
was quite sure that her husband was gone, slunk
downstairs. With a cunning that was now a trifle
threadbare, she discovered from Parker the housekeeper,
from the secretary, from the butler, by
methods which she fondly believed to be indirect,
what plans her husband had formed for the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
She sighed to learn that she might not have the
car, for she had designed to go and see her dear
old friend widow, Mrs. Hulker, formerly of Newcastle,
now of Ealing, a woman of great culture and
refinement and one who gave Maria, Lady Repton,
nearly all her information upon books and life. Of
course there was always the Tube and the Underground,
but they greatly wearied this elderly lady,
and it was too far to drive. She sighed a little at
her husband&#8217;s order.</p>

<p>He, meanwhile, was out in Oxford Street, and
with the rapidity that distinguishes successful men,
had decided not to take a motor-bus but to walk.
The March day was cold and clear and breezy, and
he went eastward at a happy gait. He did not need
to be at his work until close upon eleven, and even
that he knew to be full early for at least one colleague,
the stupidest of all the Directors, a certain
Bingham, upon whose late rising he counted. For
the intolerable tedium of arguing against a man who
invariably took the unintelligent side was one of the
few things which caused Sir Charles to betray some
slight shade of impatience.</p>

<p>The day pleased him, as indeed it pleased the
greater part of London, from its fineness. He
walked upon the sunny side of the street, and
his smile, though restrained and somewhat sadly
dignified, was the more genial from the influence of
the weather. His brain during this brief exercise
was not concerned, as those ignorant of our great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
men might imagine, with affairs of State, nor even
with the choice of investments upon which he was
in so short a time to determine. He was occupied
rather in planning (for his power of organisation was
famous) how exactly he should fit in his engagements
for the day.</p>

<p>A Board meeting, especially if there is any chance
of long argument with a late riser of exceptional
stupidity, may last for an indefinite time. He gave
it an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Then he must lunch, and that hour was earmarked
for a certain foreigner who could not wholly make
up his mind whether to build a certain bridge over a
certain river for a certain government or no.</p>

<p>By a quarter to three he must be in the House of
Commons to answer questions, for those which fell to
his share came early upon the paper, and it was the
pride of this exact and efficient man to keep no one
waiting. Before four he must see the manager of a
bank; the matter was urgent, he did not wish to
write or telephone. By five he must be back again
in his room in the House of Commons to receive
a deputation of gentlemen who would arrive from
his distant constituency, and who proposed with a
mixture of insistence and of fear to demand certain
commercial advantages for their town at the expense
of a neighbouring borough whose representative but
rarely busied himself with the Great Council of the
Nation.</p>

<p>At six he must order with particular care a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dinner upon which (in his opinion) the chances of
the Saltoon Development largely depended. At
seven he must dress, at eight he must dine. His
guests (many of whom to his knowledge would drink
to excess) would certainly detain him till long after
ten. He must be back in the House to vote at
eleven; for some half-hour or so after eleven he
must be present to attend a short debate (or what
he hoped would prove a short debate) concerning his
own Department. He would be lucky if he was in
bed by twelve.</p>

<p>Let the reader leave him there walking in Oxford
Street and turn her attention to George Mulross
Demaine, or rather, to Mount Popocatapetl.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT will generally be conceded that an underground
river flowing with terrific force through a region
of perennial fire, must, of its nature, form a most
insecure foundation for any large body of masonry;
and the danger of building upon such a bottom will
be the more apparent if the materials used in the
construction of the edifice be insufficiently cemented
through the business capacity of a contractor indifferent
to the voice of conscience.</p>

<p>Yet such were the conditions upon the flanks of
Mt. Popocatapetl when, in the Autumn of 1914,
it was determined to erect on such a site the
Popocatapetl Dam, for the containment of the
Popocatapetl reservoir and the ultimate irrigation
of El Plan.</p>

<p>Mt. Popocatapetl rises in a graceful cone to the
height of 22,130 feet above the level of the sea. Its
summit is crowned with eternal snows, while round
its base, in spite of numerous earthquakes, constantly
followed by the outburst of vast fountains of boiling
water, cling a score of towns and villages, some with
Spanish, others with unpronounceable names. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
these the beneficent and lengthy rule of Gen. Porfirio
Diaz has lent a political security which Nature would
do well to copy,&mdash;has led the inhabitants to seek
their treasure upon earth, and has bequeathed the
inestimable advantage of the great Popocatapetl
Dam.</p>

<p>I say the &#8220;inestimable advantage,&#8221; for though the
construction of this remarkable barrage has wholly
cut off the insufficient water supply of this region, it
has brought into the neighbourhood very considerable
sums of American money, an active demand for
labour, and a line of railway at the terminus of which
can be purchased the most enlightened newspapers
of the New World. The simplest journalist,&mdash;should
such a being be possessed of the means to travel
in these distant regions&mdash;might also inform the
residents,&mdash;should they in turn be willing to hear
him patiently,&mdash;that the irrigation of El Plan, though
150 miles distant from their now desiccated homes,
can not but react to their advantage and create a
market for their wares.</p>

<p>Mysterious designs of Providence! This mountain
(among the noblest of volcanic phenomena) was
destined to threaten with ruin a great English family,
to precipitate onto the Treasury bench a young man
of unassuming manners and of insufficient capacity,
to shake half the finances of the world, and to
determine a peerage for a man to whom such
ornaments were baubles!</p>

<p>To appreciate by what chain of circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Popocatapetl&#8217;s hoary head might with its nod produce
so distant a consequence, it is necessary for
the reader once again to fix her mind most firmly
upon the truth that an underground river flowing
with terrific force through a region of perennial fire,
must of its nature form a most insecure foundation
for any considerable body of masonry, and that the
danger of building upon such a bottom will be the
more apparent if the material used, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the light of this knowledge, which (in common
with the majority of rational beings) Ole Man
Benson possessed, an investment in the stocks of
a Company whose dividends depended upon the
security of such an edifice might have seemed to
those ill-acquainted with our modern Captains of
Industry, an unpardonable folly.</p>

<p>It is none the less true that Ole Man Benson
carried a heavy load of &#8220;Popocatapetls,&#8221; naked and
unashamed.</p>

<p>He did not positively control Popocatapetls.
Heaven forbid! But apart from a considerable
block of which he was the actual owner, no small
fraction was held by the Durango Investment
Company, the majority of whose shares being the
property of the Texas and Western Equalisation
Syndicate, gave to Ole Man Benson in his capacity
of Chief Equaliser, a distant but effective control
over the second lot of Popocatapetls in question;
while the very large investment of which the N.N.O.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and S.L. Line had made at his command of their
reserve funds in the same company, gave him in his
capacity of Chief Terroriser thereof yet a third grip
upon the venture.</p>

<p>One way and another Ole Man Benson stood in
for Popocatapetls in a manner as healthy as it was
unmistakable. And strangely enough, the fiercer
the perennial fires and the louder the roaring of the
subterranean river, the more steadily did Popocatapetls
rise, the more sublimely did Wall Street urge their
ascension, the more vigorously did the American
investor (who was alone concerned) buy as he was
told until, upon a certain day, a great Republican
statesman of undoubted integrity but of perhaps too
high an idealism, was announced to speak upon
the great national enterprise.</p>

<p>Ole Man Benson loved, trusted and revered this
statesman and supported him in every way: his
name escapes me, but upon his decision the future
of the undertaking would without question lie; and
such was the bond between the two men that the
politician had not hesitated to receive from the
capitalist certain rough notes which had been jotted
down in the office for the supreme verdict which was
to be delivered to the nation.</p>

<p>It was to be delivered at Washington upon a
certain Wednesday (the date is memorable) at the
unconventional hour of ten, in order that a full report
of it might reach the foolish and the wise in New
York City in ample time for its effects to be fully felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
upon the markets; and <i>Ole Man Benson</i> had given
instructions to sell not later than half-past three of
that same fateful Wednesday.</p>

<p>But what, you cry (if such is your habit), what
of all this in connection with the ancient houses of
this land? With the Cabinet? With peerages and
the rest?</p>

<p>Tut! Have you never heard how sensitive is
the modern world to every breath of commercial
news, and how all the modern world is one? Well
then, I must explain:</p>

<p>Some two years before, in London, one <span class="smcap">George
Mulross Demaine</span> had lain languishing for lack
of money.</p>

<p>He was of good birth, and doubtless had he possessed
a secure and flowing fortune, his natural
diffidence would have been less pronounced, and the
strange fatality by which he could hardly place his
hands and feet in any position without causing some
slight accident to the furniture, would have passed
unnoticed, or would have been put down to good
nature. But George Mulross was wholly devoid of
means.</p>

<p>George Mulross Demaine, like so many of his
rank, was related to Mary Smith.</p>

<p>Now Mary Smith, her pleasing, energetic person,
her lively eyes and dear soul, the reader can never
fully know unless she has perused or rather learned
by heart, that entrancing work, &#8220;Mr. Clutterbuck&#8217;s
Election,&#8221; in which, like a good fairy, she plumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
across the scene and is perceived to be the friend,
the confidant, the cousin, the sister-in-law or the
aunt of at least three-quarters of what counts in
England.</p>

<p>She will not feel, I say, unless she has made that
work her bible, how from St. James&#8217;s Place Mary
Smith blessed Society with her jolly little hands, and
indulged in the companionship of characters as varied
as the Peabody Yid and Victoria Mosel.</p>

<p>What a woman! Her little shooting-box in
Scotland! Her place in the West Country! The
country house which she so rarely visited in the
Midlands but which she lent in the freest manner!
Her vivacity, her charm, her go, her scraps of French&mdash;her
inheritance from her late husband, himself an
American and Smith, as I need hardly say, by name!</p>

<p>The reader unacquainted with the Work which
I refer her to, must further have introduced to her
at the proper place the notable figure of cousin
William Bailey, at what an expense of repetition
upon my part I need hardly say. He also was of
the gang; he also had been elected of the people:
but violent eccentricities now kept him apart from
his true world. Thus he professed a vast interest
in Jews, making them out to be the secret masters
of England. How far that fanaticism was sincere,
he could not himself have told you. It diverted him
hugely to discover mares&#8217; nests of every kind; he was
never happier than when he was tracking the relationship
between governing families or the connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of some spotless politician with a spotted financial
adventure. There was but one excuse for his manias,
that he remained, through the most ardent pursuit
of them, a genial cynic. We shall meet him again.</p>

<p>Mary Smith, then, was related to all of them and
they were all related to each other, and in their
relationship there was friendship also, and they
governed England and the taxes bore them on.</p>

<p>That the Leader of the Opposition should be
Mary Smith&#8217;s close friend goes without saying;
much closer and dearer to her was her other cousin,
the young and popular Prime Minister, to his friends
Dolly, to the world a more dignified name, who
suffered slightly from his left lung. He had attained
his high position before his fiftieth year was closed.
For over four years he had conducted with consummate
skill the fortunes of the Nationalist Party,
and was at that very moment when Popocatapetl
nursed so sullenly its internal rage, piloting in distant
Westminster the Broadening of the Streets Bill
through an excited session of Parliament.</p>

<p>But of all her relatives, near or distant, of all the
friends whom she called by their Christian name, not
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not the First Sea
Lord, not the six chief members of the front Opposition
bench, not the eight or nine disappointed men
with corner seats, not the score or so of great financiers
whom she honoured at her board,&mdash;not the
Secretary of State for the Colonies (a diminished
post since the Sarawatta business),&mdash;not the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and popular Prime Minister himself, who suffered
slightly from the left lung,&mdash;was quite so dear to
her as that sort of nephew, George Mulross Demaine.</p>

<p>The relationship was distant, and it was less on
account of the ties of blood than by reason of the
strong friendship that had always existed between his
father and herself that Mary Smith first befriended
the lad as she had already befriended so many others.
For Demaine&#8217;s father, though what the world would
call a failure and even for many years separated from
his wife, had always exercised a peculiar charm over
his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Opinion had been sharply divided upon several
episodes of his life, so sharply that towards the
close of it he preferred to live abroad, and George&#8217;s
boyhood had been passed in the most uneasy of
experiences, now with his father in Ireland, now
with his mother in the neighbourhood of Constantinople,
and occasionally under the roof of Mary
Smith during her short married life.</p>

<p>She had grown to do for him what she would not
do for another&mdash;for Charlie Fitzgerald for instance,&mdash;for
he was not a scatterbrain nor one to get rid
of money with nothing to show for it. He was
simply a quiet, unostentatious English lad, a little
awkward (as we know) with his hands and feet but
hiding a heart of gold, and destined to inherit
nothing. He was not yet of age when his mother
died, and during the first years of his manhood he
passed more and more time under the roof of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
kindly and powerful woman who had determined
that the misfortunes or faults of his parents should
not be visited upon him.</p>

<p>She took him everywhere, she kept him in pocket
money and, most important of all, two years ago
she had arranged his marriage.</p>

<p>The moment was opportune: he was twenty-five,
he had lost his father, he was penniless, the title of
Grinstead into which he would certainly come was
distant and was unprovided for. He had not chosen,
or rather had not been given, the opportunity of
entering, the army, but there had been just enough
bungling about that to make him miss the university
also. He was so unfitted for diplomacy that even
William Bailey, who was accustomed to recommend
for that profession the least vivacious of his young
friends, shook his head when it was proposed, and
after a very short experience in Paris he was withdrawn
from it.</p>

<p>No profession naturally proposed itself to a man
of his talents, and he had not the initiative to live
as a free lance. His marriage, therefore, was one
of these providential things which seemed to fit
almost too exactly into the general scheme of life
to be true. He met his wife when Mary Smith
(after making all her inquiries at the Petheringtons&#8217;)
had caught and branded that heiress: and the wife
so branded was Sudie Benson, the daughter of so
wealthy an American as made the traffic of London
not infrequently halt for his convenience, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rather more than two years before my story bursts
open, had seen fit to bring the radiant girl to
London.</p>

<p>The two were forcibly introduced&mdash;I mean the
boy and the girl&mdash;they understood from the first
what their destiny was to be. She could find no
fault in the society which swam round her and to
which such a marriage would introduce her activities;
he saw no drawback to the alliance save one or two
mannerisms in his prospective father-in-law, which
time might modify&mdash;or on the other hand, might not.</p>

<p>Ole Man Benson, to give him once more the name
by which he was known and hated in another sphere,
from the first ten thousand<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which by the age of
forty-three he had laboriously accumulated in
shredded codfish, had dealt not with things, as do
lesser men, but with figures. He had gone boldly
forward like a young Napoleon, using, it must be
remembered, not only the money of others but very
often his own as well.</p>

<p>He had been born of Scotch-Irish parents, probably
of the name of Benson, and certainly married in the
First Baptist Church of Cincinnati not quite three-quarters
of a century ago. He was the youngest
child of a numerous family, and was baptized or
named after the poet Theocritus, with a second or
middle name of Chepstow, which in his signature he
commonly reduced to its initial letter.</p>

<p>Theocritus C. Benson, now familiar to the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon race of every colour and clime, was
of that type always rare but now, though rare, conspicuous,
which can so organise and direct the acts
of others as to bring order out of chaos, chaos out
of order, and alternately accumulate and disperse
fortunes hitherto unprecedented in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>He was accustomed (in the interviews which he
was proud to grant to the newspapers of England,
America and the Colonies) to ascribe his great
position to unwearied industry and to an abhorrence
of all excess (notably in the consumption of fermented
liquors) and particularly of the horrid practice
of gambling. His puritan upbringing, which had
taught him to look upon cards as the Devil&#8217;s picture-book,
and upon racing as akin to the drama in its
spiritual blight, was, he would constantly assert,
the key to all that he had done since he left his
father&#8217;s home. But in this manly self-judgment the
Hon. Mr. Benson did himself an injustice. These
high qualities are to be discovered in many million
of his fellow-citizens, and he might as well have
pointed, as sometimes he did point with pride, to
the number of his Lodge or to his ignorance of
foreign languages as the causes of his repeated
triumphs.</p>

<p>There was more: To his hatred of hazard and to
his stern sense of duty and unbending industry, he
added something of that daring which has made for
the greatness of the blood in all its adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Overseas, and for no branch more than for the
Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>He would boldly advance sums in blind confidence
of the future, the mere total of which would have
appalled a lesser man, and he would as boldly withdraw
them to the ruin of prosperous concerns, where
another would have been content to let production
take its own course. And this fine command of
cash and of credit which he used as a General uses
an army, had in it something of personal courage;
for towards the latter part of his life, when he had
come to control a vast private fortune, it was imperative
that in many a bold conception he himself
should stand to lose or gain.</p>

<p>At the moment when his only daughter left her
happy Belgian convent to be presented at the Court
of St. James, he was, though at the height of his
fortunes, a lonely and to some extent an embittered
man.</p>

<p>His wife had married another: their only child
he had not seen for three years, and though he knew
that her robust common sense would stand against
the religious environment of the gentle nuns who
had been entrusted with her upbringing, yet he could
not but feel that she had passed the most formative
years of her life in an alien air, and under influences
quite other than those of the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p>He had therefore determined to decline numerous
and advantageous offers and to be present himself
in London during the season which saw her introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to the world, and there, in spite of his
unfamiliarity with English ways, he soon appreciated
the central position of Mary Smith whose late
husband indeed he had come across a quarter of a
century before when he was freezing the Topekas
off the Pit.</p>

<p>Theocritus C. Benson had seen young Demaine
and was contented; he was also naturally anxious
to come across old Lord Grinstead if possible, that
he might estimate for himself how long his daughter
might have to wait for her title. Indeed he would
not allow the marriage to take place until the old
man had been pointed out to him, shrivelled almost
to nothingness and pulled with extreme caution and
deliberation in a bath-chair through the private
gardens of Bayton House.</p>

<p>Had he known that the figure thus exhibited to
him so far from being that of the aged peer was but
the carcase of a ruined dependant it would perhaps
have done little to alter his decision, for though
Lord Grinstead was of gigantic stature, with purple
face and thunderous voice, yet his habit of gross and
excessive drinking gave him a tenure of life at least
as precarious as that of the enfeebled figure upon
which the financier had gazed; and what is more,
Lord Grinstead, though an execrable horseman,
had suddenly begun to hunt upon hired mounts
with a recklessness and tenacity which, if from that
cause alone, should speedily ensure a violent death.</p>

<p>When all was happily settled, when Demaine had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
been given away by his principal creditor, and Sudie
by her upright and handsome old father, when the
last of the wedding gifts had been exchanged at the
usual discount and the young couple had gone off to
Honiton Castle which had been lent them for £2000
during the honeymoon, another aspect of life had to
be considered.</p>

<p>A point upon which Mary Smith had done her
best and failed was the settlements&mdash;£1500 a year
to stand between his child and starvation or worse,
Theocritus was willing to determine. It was the
sum he had himself named before the first negotiations
were begun; but as they proceeded he refused
to change it by one penny, and at last the discussion
was abandoned in despair. All the young people
might need they should have&mdash;she was his only
child, they could trust him to be more than generous.
Capital sums when they were required for anything
but direct investment, should be always at their
disposal, and the half or more than the half of his
enormous income should be ready to their call; but
he resolutely retained to himself the right to control
the management of all save the infinitesimal sum
which was to stand between Sudie and her husband&#8217;s
tyranny, or the world&#8217;s harshness.</p>

<p>Mary Smith&#8217;s veiled threats and open flattery were
alike useless. She capitulated, told the young
woman to earmark her tiny allowance for journeys,
and gained from Theocritus Chepstow only this:&mdash;that
he would buy a freehold for them, build and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
furnish it. Theocritus was on like a bird; and the
lovely little lodge which London now knows as
Demaine House, with its curious formal gardens, odd
Dutch stables and Grecian weathercock on the site
of the old mews in what is now Benson Street, is the
proof that he kept his promise.</p>

<p>For a year Ole Man Benson had not only kept his
promise in the way of building and furnishing for
the young people: he had done more. He had
floated them upon London with all the revenue that
could be reserved from the new venture upon which
he designed to double the colossal sums which
directly or indirectly stood to his name, and every
penny that he could spare from his first early
purchases of Popocatapetls went into the status and
future social position of his daughter. Now, after
two years, Popocatapetl Dam was finished and yet
greater things lay before them.</p>

<p>Demaine was put into Parliament by a majority
comparable only to the financial advantages which
had secured it. His birth, her voice and its timbre,
gathered into Demaine House all that so small a
Great House could hold.</p>

<p>So things had stood to within a week of the
March day upon which we saw that very different
man, Charles Repton, walking into the City of
London....</p>

<p>But from the name of Charles Repton let me
rapidly slew off to the sombre pyramid of that
peak in the neighbourhood of Darien and recall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
caprice of Popocatapetl upon which so much was to
depend.</p>

<p>It was a Wednesday in that March of 1915 that
the Statesman was to speak in Washington at ten:
(for two years Demaine House had thriven, it slept
that Tuesday night unconscious of its fate). It was
for the Wednesday at 3.30 that the order to sell
stood in Ole Man Benson&#8217;s name.... Well ...</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LATE upon that Tuesday night Ole Man Benson
boarded the Louis XV. Rosewood Express
de Luxe as it steamed out of the Chicago Depot of
the M.N. &amp; C.: he was off to his mountain property
in Idaho, and in the privacy of his section, Ole Man
Benson slept.</p>

<p>Not so the forces of Nature, so often destructive
of the schemes of pigmy man!</p>

<p>An appalling convulsion altogether exceeding
anything heard or dreamt of since the beginning of
time, totally destroyed the Popocatapetelian landscape
in the small hours of that same morning; and
as, a thousand miles to the north, the Louis XV.
Rosewood Express de Luxe rolled in a terrific
manner upon its insufficient rock ballast, the
subterranean river, the perennial fires and the unscrupulously
erected edifice of the great dam, shot
aloft in a vast confusion and were replaced by a
chasm some quarter of a mile in breadth and of a
depth unfathomable to mortal plummets. It was
March; March 1915. In Iowa in March it snows.
The locomotive and two of the cars attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Louis XV. Rosewood Express de Luxe were
buried a little beyond Blucher in a drift of snow
the height and dimensions of which exceeded
the experience of the oldest settler in that charming
prairie town. <i>The same storm which had caused
the misadventure had broken the wires for many miles
around.</i></p>

<p>Ole Man Benson awoke, therefore, to a scene of
great discomfort, but upon such a date and with a
prospect of so considerable an increase of fortune
awaiting him upon that very day, he was the gayest
of the company, and in spite of his years he
shovelled away with the best of them, a-splendid-type-of-Anglo-Saxon-manhood.</p>

<p>By one o&#8217;clock that noon the telegraph at last
was working, and the first messages came through
to the little depot; they concerned a riot in a local
home for paralytics. Next, before two, news was
conveyed of an outbreak of religious mania in the
town of Omaha. It was not till a late hour in the
evening that Ole Man Benson, waiting anxiously
for the report of the great speech, heard the earliest
tidings of the practical joke which Providence&mdash;in
spite of Gen. Porfirio Diaz&#8217; equable and masterly
rule&mdash;had played him in the distant tropics.</p>

<p>The same rapidity of thought which had enabled
Theocritus to accumulate his vast fortune enabled
him in that moment to perceive that he was ruined.
Not indeed necessarily for ever,&mdash;he had known
such things before&mdash;but at any rate in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sufficiently hefty to produce his immediate collapse.</p>

<p>When, next morning, he could bring himself to
read the papers, the disaster appeared before him
in its exact proportions and tremendous scale.</p>

<p>That speech, that statesman-like speech, had never
been delivered&mdash;and for the best of reasons:
Popocatapetl had unbosomed first! In the wild
fall of prices nothing had done more to ruin the
market than the heavy selling of agents acting on
account of Theocritus C. Benson. There were
dozens within the roaring walls of the building in
Wall Street, thousands in the anxious streets without,
who saw in the Benson selling yet another move of
diabolical cunning proceeding from that Napoleonic
brain. His agents had done their work thoroughly
and well. They had anticipated his orders with
such promptitude that no stock was left unsaleable
upon their hands, and when, before the end of that
black day, Popocatapetls were offering at the cost of
haulage, they could proudly say that every interest
of their client&#8217;s in the ruined concern had been
disposed of. And Theocritus C. Benson, henceforward
known as the Earthquake King, was left
with no unsaleable paper upon his hands, but on the
contrary with a solid cash result equivalent to at
least three cents on the dollar of his yesterday&#8217;s
fortune. This it is to be faithfully served in the
intricacies of modern speculation!</p>

<p>A truce to Ole Man Benson! If I have introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
his wretched commercial adventures at such
length it is but to explain the portentous effect
which they had upon the fortunes of one British
statesman.</p>

<p>Far off in London (Eng.) George Mulross Demaine
saw nothing in his morning newspaper but the news
(to him a serious matter) that Pink Eye was scratched
for the Grand National. His wife, whom her father
had shielded from the vulgar atmosphere of
commerce, noted indeed the news from the Western
Hemisphere and was for a passing moment concerned;
but Ole Man Benson did not telegraph,
for there were no flies upon him, nor did Ole Man
Benson even write, and for the same entomological
reason.</p>

<p>Oh! no. Ole Man Benson proceeded to New
York, had certain interviews with certain people, took
certain drugs, went through a certain cure, laid as
he hoped the foundations of yet another scheme, and
not until 30th of March, a full week after the matter
I have described, did Theocritus dictate a brief note
to his daughter, which I will here transcribe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>(If not delivered, please return &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; within three days to<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Theocritus C. Benson.)<br /></td>

<span class="smcap">New York City</span><br />

</table>

<p>Coming across on Potassic. Depart 4th&mdash;probable
arrival Plymouth 11th. Shall cable.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Father</span>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>With true business instinct the great organiser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
dispatched the cable upon the 4th of April, so that
his daughter received upon the evening of the same
day in her London house the reassuring word
&#8220;eleventh,&#8221; which her reception of the letter a few
days later easily enabled her to comprehend; and
on 11th of April, sure enough, Ole Man Benson
in a grave and sober manner embraced his daughter
on the landing-stage at Plymouth. George Mulross
Demaine was also there, standing a little behind the
affectionate group, clothed in a large green ulster
and a cap of the same cloth and colour with an
enormous peak.</p>

<p>They got into the train together and all the way
up to London the master of empty millions said
nothing.</p>

<p>As they were driving to Demaine House he spoke:
&#8220;Any o&#8217; your folk to supper?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>His daughter with filial gaiety assured him that
she had waited his orders, to which he replied, &#8220;Good
girl Sudie.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the meal he was as silent as he had been
upon the journey, and at the end of it he gave his
son-in-law to understand that he desired to talk
business with his daughter and preferred to be alone
with her: and George Mulross went out, taking his
wine with him, for his wife&#8217;s father drank none, but
only Toxine.</p>

<p>The message Ole Man Benson had to deliver to
Sudie was simple enough: there would, for he could
not say how long, be no more money forthcoming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
He hoped the position might be retrieved; he was
confident it would be retrieved before the Fall, by
Thanksgiving at latest. Till then, nit!</p>

<p>Sudie had all her father&#8217;s readiness; she pointed
out to him at once that under the conditions of
English politics the total cessation of an income the
source of which was familiar to her husband&#8217;s friends,
would at once affect her father&#8217;s credit in future
transactions, and clearly showed that no investment
could be more to his advantage than the placing of
sums at her disposal for the proper up-keep of his
daughter&#8217;s position in the society of London.</p>

<p>To this powerful argument Theocritus immediately
replied that those who looked for hens&#8217; teeth were
liable to be stung; that cigars containing explosive
matter had been offered him too frequently in the
past for him now to entertain the thought of consuming
them; and that when he was bulling London
he would advise. By which parables he intended to,
and did, convey to his daughter his fixed conclusion
that it was up to her to bear futures: and lest she
should have failed wholly to seize his point, he told
her briefly and in the plainest terms that whatever
rocks were going were wanted&mdash;badly&mdash;to sling at
something with more dough in it than Mayfair.</p>

<p>With that their brief discourse was ended.</p>

<p>This little conversation over, Demaine was given to
understand that he might re-enter the room. He
was a little shy in doing so, for interviews of this
sort usually meant some new gift or subsidy, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was shyness of a pleasant sort and he had little
doubt that he should hear in a moment the extent
or at least the nature of the new bounty which his
young household was to receive. He was therefore
only puzzled by the novelty of phrasing when his
father-in-law, looking at him in a manner rather
humorous than severe, remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve stacked it up with Sudie, and she may
stack it up with you.&#8221; Then in a kinder tone, he
added: &#8220;You catch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said George untruthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why then, &#8217;nuff&#8217;s said,&#8221; concluded the Captain of
Industry, and very thoughtfully he picked his teeth
with a long fine silver point which he habitually
carried in his waistcoat for that purpose of the
toilet. &#8220;It&#8217;s no call ter last long,&#8221; he muttered half
to himself and half to the bewildered Demaine;
&#8220;anyhow the pump&#8217;s sucking; and there&#8217;s no more
oil,&#8221;&mdash;to elucidate which somewhat cryptic phrase
Sudie begged her husband not to stand gaping there
like a booby, but to sit down and understand as much
of it as he could.</p>

<p>Whereupon in the clearest possible language,
punctuated by her father&#8217;s decisive and approving
nods, she translated into older idioms exactly what
had happened, and exactly what it meant. They
were worth just £1500 a year between them from
that day onwards for&mdash;well, till there was a change.</p>

<p>It was not tact but nervousness that prevented
George at the end of this dreadful passage from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
suggesting that his father-in-law could do again what
he had done before, that the strain was temporary,
and that he for his part hoped for the best; but his
wife, who was by this time fairly well accustomed to
follow his thought, was careful to point out that
whatever the future might do for them, the present
was dirt black, and the present meant at least two
years:</p>

<p>&#8220;At least two years?&#8221; (to her father).</p>

<p>To which her father very simply and plainly
answered her: &#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was much of the splendid blood of
Theocritus in Sudie; indeed it is often observed
that the genius of the father will descend to the
daughter&mdash;and <i>vice versa</i>. The very next sentence,
therefore, with which Sudie prodded her disconsolate
spouse, was a demand for a list of those who might
be ready to take Demaine House, to take it at once,
to take it furnished, to take it high, to take it by the
year and not for the season, and, when they had
taken it, to <i>pay</i>.</p>

<p>Demaine immediately suggested the name of such
of his acquaintance as might most desire to occupy
such a position in London, and were also least able
to do so, but he was careful to add after each
name, some such remark as &#8220;But of course they
won&#8217;t do,&#8221; or &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think he can afford it,&#8221;&mdash;until
his father-in-law in a pardonable lassitude
went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing you can do,&#8221; said his wife with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
renewed decision when they were alone, &#8220;is to get
up right here and go round to Mary&#8217;s.&#8221; For it was
a notable circumstance in Sudie&#8217;s relations with
Mrs. Smith that while that lady gave <i>her</i> her full
title, <i>she</i> would invariably allude to Mrs. Smith by
the more affectionate medium of the Christian
name.</p>

<p>Demaine assented. He found his father-in-law at
the door; they went out together into the night, and
when he had timidly admitted that he was going
South towards St. James&#8217;s, the financier with rapid
decision announced that he was going North towards
Marylebone,&mdash;and they parted.</p>

<p>Mary Smith was not in. It was only eleven and
the theatre detained her. George waited. He
took counsel from several valuable pictures, was
careful to touch and handle nothing upon her tables
(for he knew that she detested an accident and with
almost-canine-sagacity could invariably detect his
interference), and stood, not at ease.</p>

<p>She came in at twelve; she brought a party with
her, and she insisted upon supper. It was one before
she could talk to him alone, and she talked to him
until two.</p>

<p>The first thing she did was to tell him that he
could not let his house that season and that he must
make up his mind to it. The second was to discover
what balance there was at the bank&mdash;and to hear
that it was pitifully small. The third was to offer
him a short loan that would carry him over at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a few weeks of necessary expense, and the fourth to
tell him that, not upon the morrow but upon the
day after, she would have decided.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he must post a letter for her.</p>

<p>She sat down and wrote at once to William
Bailey.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you get outside, George,&#8221; she said as she
gave him the letter, &#8220;you will see a very large pillar
box. It is much larger than most pillar boxes; it
has two slits in it instead of one. Do you follow
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not put this letter in your pocket,
George,&#8221; she went on firmly and kindly, as certain
practitioners do when they propose to hypnotise
their patients. &#8220;You will carry it in front of you
like this.&#8221; She put it into his right hand, crooked
his arm, held his wrist upright, so that his eyes could
not help falling upon the missive. &#8220;The moment
you get outside you will put it in the <i>right</i>-hand slit
of the pillar box, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He said &#8220;yes&#8221; again, as humbly as before. And
as he went out he did all that she had asked him,
though to make the matter more sure she watched
for a moment from the window.</p>

<p>When William Bailey received the letter next
morning he was in the best of moods. For one
thing he was going to leave London for three weeks,&mdash;a
prospect that always delighted him. For
another he was going to do some sea fishing, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sport of which he was passionately fond. For a
third, an Austrian money-lender and a baron at that,
had shot himself&mdash;it had of course been kept out of
the English papers, but he had read all the details in
one of the anti-semitic rags which are the disgrace of
Vienna, and his spirits had risen, buoyant at the
news. Finally, and what was of perhaps most
importance for an eccentric and middle-aged celibate,
the house which he had hired for a month he knew
exactly suited him. It was the house of Merry, the
architect, and stood just so far from Parham Town
as would give him the isolation he adored, yet just
so near to Parham Harbour as would put him in touch
with the sea.</p>

<p>For all these reasons he read Mary Smith&#8217;s little
note in great gaiety of heart, and in a mood in which
men of influence are willing to do what they can for
their kind.</p>

<p>Like many men of wealth and ability whom
opportunity has made eccentric, William Bailey
could not bear to handle the pen. He hesitated for
some moments between the extreme boredom of
writing and the tantalising business of the telephone,
decided in favour of the former, wrote on a form&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">&#8220;Get Dolly to make room for him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap">(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bill</span>&#8221;&mdash;</span>
</p></div>

<p>and sent the message out to be telegraphed to his
cousin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Mary Smith, receiving it, received with it a great
light.</p>

<p>It was not always easy for her to follow the changes
that took place in political appointments, but she
was certain of <i>this</i>, that the present administration
contained more unfamiliar names than she cared to
think of, and that there <i>must</i> be room in such a crowd
for a man of poor George&#8217;s standing.</p>

<p>Now from the moment that such thoughts as these
entered Mary Smith&#8217;s head about a man&#8217;s appointment,
that man was safe: poor George&#8217;s future was
therefore ultimately secure. But there was no time
to lose. He must get on to the front bench, and he
must get there with a salary, and the salary must be
sufficient, and the promotion must be rapid. She
remembered that Dolly would be at the Petheringtons&#8217;
that evening, and she determined to be there too.
She hoped and prayed that nothing would bring
George, though since George was everywhere the
chances were against her prayer being answered.</p>

<p>For the moment she thought of warning him not
to come, then, remembering certain indiscretions of
his in the past, she thought it best to say nothing,
but to trust to chance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">CHARLES REPTON, manifold as were his
financial interests, knew nothing of Popocatapetls,
and cared less.</p>

<p>The manner in which his life was to be influenced
by that very distant cataclysm was hidden from him;
as (for that matter) it would be hidden from the reader
also had not this book been most boldly published.</p>

<p>Yet another thing the full import of which may
escape the reader, is the fact that Sir Charles
Repton was extremely tender just behind the ears;
but for this the reader herself alone and not the
author is to blame, for if the reader had any knowledge
of Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia she would have guessed at
twenty things. But no matter: Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia and
their effect upon self-control very much interrupt
the chain of those absorbing adventures which, if she
will continue, the reader will presently peruse.</p>

<p>Anyhow, those regions of the head which lie
behind either ear were for some reason or other very
tender, large, sensitive to pressure, and in a way
abnormal in Sir Charles Repton.</p>

<p>When, therefore, somewhere about the corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Tottenham Court Road (on that March day on which
we left him walking to his Board meeting), his hat
blew off: when he had run after it: when in doing
so he had ruffled his fine crop of white hair; and when,
to have it all set right, he had gone into a second-rate
barber&#8217;s, it may well be imagined that he gave
the man who served him minute instructions that the
head rest upon the back of the chair should be made
comfortable&mdash;and so it was. And on to it Sir
Charles Repton leant gingerly the head upon whose
clear action depended the future fortunes of Van
Diemens.</p>

<p>The man in brushing his hair with an apparatus
of singular power, turned the monologue on to the
commonplaces of the moment, which included the
bestiality of the Government and the abhorrent
nature of the Italian people, of whom at that particular
moment in 1915 the people of London stood
in abject terror.</p>

<p>Whether it was the pressure of the violent rotating
brush or some looseness in the screw that held the
support behind him, with a shock and a clang that
support slipped, and Sir Charles Repton&#8217;s head came
smartly down, first through nothingness and then
on to two iron nuts which exactly corresponded to
those processes of the skull just behind either ear,
in which, as I have taken pains to remark, he was
peculiarly sensitive: for they were largely developed
in him and nourished it would seem by an unusual
supply of blood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Sharp as was the pain, Charles Repton controlled
himself, listened to the explanations and apologies
of the barber, and submitted himself again to the
grooming for which he had entered.</p>

<p>When he went out again into the street he had
almost forgotten the accident. The two places where
his head had been struck swelled slightly and he
touched them now and again, but they soon passed
from his mind; within ten minutes they were no
longer painful; yet was there set up in them from
that moment, an irritation which was to have no
inconsiderable consequence.</p>

<p>He went on into the City, ordered one or two things
which he had set down in his memorandum before
starting, looked in at a City Club where he knew one
or two items of news were awaiting him, and slowly
betook himself to the offices of the Van Diemens
Company. He had thoroughly planned out the
scheme of that morning&#8217;s work; it needed no
recapitulation in his mind, yet as his habit was, just
before opening the door of the Board Room, in the
few seconds of going up the stairs, he briefly presented
his scheme of tactics to his own mind.</p>

<p>The Directors must ask the shareholders for fresh
capital; a nominal million, an increase of 25 per
cent. upon the value of the shares at par. That was
the first point.</p>

<p>The second point was the object for which this
levy should nominally be demanded. On that also
he had made up his mind. Paton had quite unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
suggested to him the master idea; a little
belt of untravelled and unknown country (locally
known as the &#8220;Out and Out&#8221;) wherein the degraded
Kawangas&mdash;so Paton had told him, and after all
Paton had been there&mdash;held their orgies in Mutchi-time,
alone separated Perks&#8217; Bay from the Straits,
and the long detour which all traffic must now make
between the coaling station and the high road to the
East, could be cut off by a line crossing that region.
Paton had assured him with immense enthusiasm
that such a line would give its possessor the strategic
key to the gate of everything East of the Bay of
Bengal, and, what was more important in Sir Charles&#8217;
eyes than Paton&#8217;s own opinion, a vast mass of
gentlemen in the suburbs of London and perhaps
five-sixths of the journalists in Fleet Street, were
ready to rally to the idea. It had been well preached
and well dinned in.</p>

<p>These two points were clear: they must ask for
a million and they must ask it for the purpose of
building a railway that would at last ensure the
Empire against the nightmare of foreign rivals.</p>

<p>There was a third point. The shareholders would
not or could not subscribe a million but that was easily
turned. They should be asked for no more than
200,000,&mdash;a shilling a share&mdash;in cash down, &#8220;the
remainder to be paid,&#8221; etc. etc.</p>

<p>Had not Sir Charles possessed an iron control of
his face, the strong set smile which he wore as he
entered the Board Room would have broadened at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the recollection of that last detail. On the other
hand had he not possessed such self-control some
movement of annoyance might have escaped him
to discover present at the table, among his other
colleagues, the late-rising and impervious Bingham.
The sight was sufficient to exasperate a man of less
balance. The hour had been carefully chosen to
avoid such an accident, and that accident meant
perhaps another half-hour or more of close argument
and of subtle effort.</p>

<p>For his colleague Bingham added to a native
idiocy of solid texture and formidable dimensions,
the experience of extensive travel; and he was in
particular well acquainted with the district with
regard to which the Board must that day make its
decision. It was certain, therefore, that his fellow-Directors
would listen to him with peculiar respect,
not only on account of his stupidity which necessarily
commanded a certain attention, but also on account
of his intimacy with plain matters of fact: he had
been upon the spot: he was the man who knew.</p>

<p>It was just as Repton had feared. Business that
might have been done in a quarter of an hour and a
decision which contained no more than the issue of
pieces of paper was turned into a long practical discussion
by the intolerable ponderance of Bingham,
who would wait until every one had had his say, and
then would bring in some dreadful little technical
point about a marsh, a rainy season or a fly; he was
careful to pepper his conversation with local terms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hundred times more remote than the Kawanga and
Mutchi-time; in every conceivable manner he put
his spoke into the wheels of business.</p>

<p>So considerable was the effect produced by the
redoubtable Bingham at that table that, were Cæsarism
a common political theory in elderly men, the
whole conduct of Van Diemens would for the future
have been put into his hands. Luckily for the
Company its forms were not so democratic.</p>

<p>Charles Repton waited patiently. When he spoke
his point was as simple as falling off a log: what was
wanted was not a railway in itself, it was a new issue
of capital. He was profoundly indifferent what label
should be tied onto that issue, so long as it was a
label good enough to get the original shareholders to
come in. The public would never come in as things
were: its pusillanimity was increased by the fact that
the Company had been in existence for now eleven
years and had hitherto failed to pay a dividend of
any kind. After some thought he had decided, in
company with one or two others upon the Board, that
a railway through a certain district of the concession,
locally known as &#8220;The Out and Out,&#8221; and remarkable
for the fact that no white man had yet visited it, would
be the best attraction he could offer. He was prepared
to show by the aid of maps upon which should
be marked all favourable things, that a line driven
through this district would unite with the world two
provinces teeming with inexhaustible wealth, of a
heavenly climate, and hitherto by the mere accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Out and Out belt, cut off from the longing
embraces of commerce. More; he could show that
this single line of railway would bestow upon his
beloved country so vast a strategic superiority over
all other nations as would ensure her immediate
success in any campaign, no matter what the quality
of the troops she might employ. To this he added
the attractions of touring in the tropics and the allurements
of big game for those wealthy gentlemen whom
he designed in the new prospectus to term Shikaris.</p>

<p>With the new capital subscribed and long before
the line was surveyed, there was little doubt that the
shares which had fallen from over £9 to the comparatively
low quotation&mdash;but oh! not price&mdash;of
16/3 (at which quotation he had first consented
to tender his services to the Company) would rise to
certainly over £1, perhaps to nearer £2, and what
was more to the point they would be readily saleable.
He was prepared in that event to transfer his property
in them to others, a course which he sincerely hoped
his fellow-shareholders would also follow, though of
course he would not take it upon himself to advise
any one of them.</p>

<p>Bingham, like the practical man he was, pinned
himself to the railway. He <i>knew</i> the Out and Out;
not that he&#8217;d ever been there,&mdash;no white man had,&mdash;but
he had talked to several of the Kawanga in
Mutchi-time, and he shook his head despondently.
There was one continuous line of precipice 3000 feet
deep; there was a river which was now a stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
five miles broad, now a marsh and now again dry&mdash;, sometimes
for years on end. There was a dense mass
of forest; there was that much more difficult thing,
a belt of shifting sand dunes; there were nearly 300
miles without water through these. He was prepared
to speak all day upon the difficulties of building a
railway which none but the least intelligent had ever
designed to build.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Repton could ride himself on the curb,
and more than anything else this mastery had given
him his present great position; but that day he had to
exercise his will to the full, and in that exercise he felt
slight twinges behind the ear where the barber&#8217;s rest
had struck him. It was all he could do to prevent
himself from drumming on the table or from making
those interruptions which only serve as fuel to the
slow criticisms of the dull.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;and heaven knows with what subtlety and
patience&mdash;he conquered. There was a vote (a thing
he had wished to avoid), but he carried it by two;
and it was agreed that the issue of new capital
should be made, that a General Meeting of the shareholders
should be called for Tuesday the 2nd of June,
and that he, Repton, should have the task of laying
the scheme before them. The new prospectus, which
he had already drafted, was passed round and with
a very few emendations accepted. Then, after as
heavy a bit of work as had ever been undertaken in
the way of persuasion, the principal brain in that
company was at last free for other things.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>It was half-past one. He had just time to meet
and to convince yet another fool upon another matter:
the foreigner acting as agent for his Government, on
the matter of the bridge: a bridge which the Foreign
Government might or might not build, and, if they
built, might or might not order from a firm which
Repton had reason to befriend. Repton must lunch
with that foreigner: he must persuade him to build:
he must get the order&mdash;then he must be in his place
in the House in time for questions.</p>

<p>The foreigner was as wax in his hands: not as
good warm wax, adulterated wax, candle wax, but
rather as beeswax, very ancient and hard. It was
a full hour before that wax was pliable, but once
again the unceasing, managed, strict watchfulness,
the set face which had always in it something stern
but never anything aggressive, the balance of judgment,
conquered. Down to the smallest detail of
that conversation Repton was the artist, his host at
the lunch was the public, accepting and gradually
convinced, and the bridge was ordered for the
Foreign Government, though it was a useless bridge
leading from nowhere to nowhere, and though it
could have been built much more solidly and
much better by the people of the place than by
the English firm.</p>

<p>Then Repton went on to the House of Commons,
and there, as in every duty of the day, the weight of
his character told.</p>

<p>The questions were slight, there were not half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dozen that concerned his Department, but he answered
them all with that curious restraint of tone which somehow
made it difficult to cross-examine his Department.
And he faced the House with such a poise
and expression that one almost wondered, as one
looked at him, upon which side he was sitting, or
whether indeed the mere game of In&#8217;s and Out&#8217;s
entered into his brain at all.</p>

<p>He seemed to be quite above the divisions of party.
He seemed a sort of Ambassador from the permanent
officials and to carry into the House of Commons an
atmosphere at once judicial and experienced which
no one could resist. When he had first accepted the
Wardenship of the Court of Dowry it had been
wondered that he should take so secondary a post.
Now, after these four years, it was rather wondered
why no one had seen till then the possibilities that
lay in the position.</p>

<p>After that typical and decisive day, Repton, for
more than a month, refrained from debate.</p>

<p>He was ever in his seat on those two days in each
week when it was his business to answer questions:
he never let his understrapper appear for him; for
one full fortnight he was permanently in attendance,
watching the fortunes before a select committee of a
certain Bill, for which the public cared nothing but
which he knew might change in a very important
particular the public fortune&mdash;but in general he
seemed to be in retirement. He was planning hard.</p>

<p>A mixture of Imperial sentiment and personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pride urged him to put Van Diemens on their legs,
and all April, all through the Easter Recess, he
remained in London working. He worked right on
into May; for the first week after Parliament met
again he was seen but little; one thing only troubled
him, that at long intervals&mdash;sometimes as long as ten
days, an uneasy twinge behind the ears, the result of
that little half-forgotten accident, incommoded him.
These twinges came a trifle more frequently as May
advanced. After the last of them he had felt a little
dazed&mdash;no more. And still he worked and worked,
holding twenty reins in his hands.</p>

<p>Before the end of May the fruit of all this labour
began to appear. Camptons were reconstructed,
arbitration had been forced upon the Docks combination
in the North just in time to prevent a wholesale
transference of shipping abroad, and more important
than all, perhaps, there had begun to crop up in the
papers, here, there, and everywhere, the mention&mdash;and
the flattering mention&mdash;of Van Diemens, and the
wealthy were already familiar with the conception of
a certain railway in the land which was under the
Van Diemens charter.</p>

<p>The wealthy, but as yet only the wealthy; it is as
fatal to be too early as to be too late, and that brain
which knew how to drive and compel, had also known
so well how to restrain, that the shares still remained
unsaleable with the meaningless quotation of
sixteen shillings and a few fluctuating pence still
attached to them in the market lists.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>So Repton stood in the middle of May, 1915, when
he became aware that an obscure member (obscure
at least in the House of Commons&mdash;and Repton
noticed little of, and cared nothing for, the merely
luxurious world of London), an aristocrat of sorts,
one of the <i>Demaine</i>,&mdash;George Demaine it seemed,
was being talked about. He was being pushed somehow.
Repton hardly heeded so commonplace a
phenomenon, save perhaps to wonder what job
was on:&mdash;he continued to push Van Diemens.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Petheringtons&#8217; house, to which Mary Smith
drove on the evening of 12th of April,
under the two pretty little electric lights of her
car, one for either side of her face, was one of a
hundred similar London houses, a huge brown cube
in the middle of Grosvenor Square.</p>

<p>It was no longer called Petherington House; it
had once again regained its more familiar appellation
of No. 89, under which it had been famous for the
complete lack of entertainment of any sort which had
distinguished the short session of 1912. Then old
Hooker had died, the changes in the Cabinet had
come, Hooker&#8217;s wife had married the Bishop and also
died immediately, and finally the Petheringtons had
taken the place, foolishly called it by their own title
for a few months, and finding it unknown to cabmen
and to their friends&#8217; chauffeurs also under this
appellation, they slowly reverted to the old name.</p>

<p>If hospitality is a fault when pushed to an extreme,
the Petheringtons exhibited that fault. But so
excellent were their arrangements&mdash;for business will
out even in the smallest details of domestic life&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
no one suffered in the crush, and that it was
perfectly easy in the time a guest ordinarily allowed
himself for the function, to go up the stairs and down
again, though perhaps too much time was wasted
at the necessarily narrow entrance where men must
seek their hats and coats.</p>

<p>The movement of Society in this particular case
was rendered the more facile by the emptiness of the
hall, from which everything had been taken except
the Great Stuffed Bear which had been shot by the
servant of a trapper who had sold it to the correspondent
of the furrier of Lady Petherington, and
which now stood holding a tray, with an expression
of extreme ferocity, and labelled &#8220;The Caucasus,
17th June, 1910,&#8221;&mdash;for in those mountains Mr.
Petherington&mdash;as he then was&mdash;had travelled.</p>

<p>Mary Smith was not disappointed. Mooning
aimlessly about the crowded rooms above, in an
atmosphere surcharged with mauve Moravian
music&mdash;the loudest of its kind&mdash;shuffled the anxious
and slightly bowed form of Dolly, the young and
popular Prime Minister.</p>

<p>A foreigner might have thought him to have few
friends, so slowly did he proceed and with so curious
a gaze from one group to another, seeming half
stunned by the vigour of the band and fascinated by
the vigorous contortions of Mr. Arthur Worth who
conducted it for all he was&mdash;I mean with his utmost
capacity of gesture and expression. That foreigner
would have suffered an illusion. The Prime Minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was perfectly well known in face and figure to every
one in that room, and there were few who did not
hope for some advantage from his presence, but
fewer, far fewer still, who attempted to obtain it. I
must of course except Professor Kahn.</p>

<p>Dolly knew his Mary Smith, and resigned himself
to suffer. She had not come there that night for
nothing. She got up to him within half a minute
of the view, and found him with peculiar dexterity
through a maze of wealthy people. She quietly took
him away, and sat him in a large chair that stood
in a remote recess, where the light was subdued; she
took advantage of a deafening crash in the music to
which its previous successes were child&#8217;s play, and
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to have your next move?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister implored her not to talk shop.
Then somewhat inconsequently he added, weakening:
&#8220;Why do you want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>The music was now whining and part of it was
taking breath for another charge. It was therefore
in quite a low but exceedingly business-like tone that
Mary Smith remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I want you to do something for
Dimmy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name suggested to the Prime Minister one of
twenty little jobs; he thought of a jolly little one in
Ireland. But she added: &#8220;You know what has
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>She told him briefly: Ole Man Benson was broke.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister remembered the explosion of
Popocatapetl: he had vaguely connected the news
with something at the time: now he knew what it
was. He looked extremely grave. And when Mary
went on to tell him that Mrs. Demaine had only
£1500 he looked graver still.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything of a big sort going just now,
Mary,&#8221; he said in quite another tone. But he was
thinking his clearest. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know him as well as
you do,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Can he <i>do</i> anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mary Smith decidedly, &#8220;he can&#8217;t. But
he&#8217;d go well in harness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister seemed to live more actively
as he considered the problem. The warm air, the
scent of clothes and flowers suited him well.</p>

<p>The trouble with his left lung which had so
endeared him to his fellow-citizens, he felt far less
keenly in the beginning of a warm spring than at
any other time, and evenings such as this rewarded
him for the sacrifice he made every winter to his
duty and to England. Of the four years during
which he had held the highest of human offices he had
spent but one winter on the Riviera, and though it
had been necessary in one year to forego an Autumn
session, such a session had not in the other three
years delayed the meeting of Parliament beyond the
end of February. His youth stood him in good stead
during this ordeal; but there were those (and they
were they who loved him most) who looked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
anxiety upon the frail form and thought, although
they dared not say, that the years were slipping by
and that what a man could do with impunity when
still upon the right side of fifty, would become
another matter when his fifty-fifth year was passed....
There was of course always the hope of opposition
and its leisure.... The Broadening of the
Streets Bill had roused a tempest of Party passion....
He had already been publicly stoned in the
North.... But no matter; for the moment the
Prime Minister was full of appreciation, and for his
cousin&#8217;s purposes in the kindliest of moods.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he thought (and his cousin read his
thoughts) that she was asking the impossible. An
idea struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Dimmy been called to the Bar?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>She looked up, puzzled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so....
No, I know he hasn&#8217;t. I put up a hundred for him
in 1908 and he buzzed it. I should certainly have
heard if he had done anything more before his
marriage. Naturally <i>since</i> then....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, naturally,&#8221; said the Prime Minister
sympathetically. He mused. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t go
abroad?&#8221; he said, looking round.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth&#8217;s the good of that?&#8221; said Mary
Smith a little testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the Prime Minister vaguely, as
he reviewed certain posts in his mind, &#8220;... No.
There isn&#8217;t much in that. Anything that could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of any use wants leading up to.&#8221; And he plunged
into thought again.</p>

<p>Then with a gesture that many had noticed in him
and had thought a mere idle trick but which was
really an accompaniment to calculation, he put his
ten fingers down upon his knees and lifted them
slowly one after another. When he had so lifted
nine (it was the ring finger of his left hand) a touch
of animation passed over his face, an expression his
cousin could see even in that subdued light.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long does he want it for?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mary Smith was inclined to say &#8220;For ever,&#8221; but
she checked herself; she remembered the face and
manner of Theocritus C. Benson, she trusted his
future fortune, and she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think even a little while would make a
difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were both thinking of the same thing. But
the Prime Minister understood what perhaps she
did not, that there is no such thing as autocratic
intervention in our public life, that time is required
for every innovation, and that he who leads must
also follow. He was reviewing as she spoke the
prejudices and the ambitions of perhaps twenty men,
and the power of each. When he spoke again it was
as though his decision were final:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I could do anything for him in
the House. He&#8217;s hardly ever spoken, and when he
did he made a fool of himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mary sympathetically.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s the only man,&#8221; went on Dolly reflectively,
&#8220;whom I&#8217;ve ever seen fall right <i>off</i> a bench in the
House of Commons....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean he&#8217;s physically awkward?&#8221; replied
Mary in the tone of a woman who knows how to
despise such trifles&mdash;but she scented danger. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never known Dimmy betray one word that was
confided to him,&#8221; she continued gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one were beginning all over again,&#8221; said Dolly,
as though thinking aloud. &#8220;But then,&#8221; he added,
getting up from his chair and making as though to
walk away,&mdash;&#8220;<i>that&#8217;s</i> impossible,&mdash;there&#8217;s Repton.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been said that women are inconsequent in
their conversation and that if they desire to obtain a
favour they do so by disconnected hints which men
cannot follow. It may be so. But perhaps on this
very account do they succeed. At any rate from the
moment that the Prime Minister had let drop the
phrase &#8220;there&#8217;s Repton,&#8221; Mary Smith&#8217;s plan was
formed. She did not like Sir Charles Repton, largely
because he had not known her well. She had half
forgotten him; she understood now that in some way
he stood as an obstacle to what she desired for poor
George, and from that moment she determined that
Repton should be thrust into the House of Lords.
All she said was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I forgot Repton.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she went back into the crowded rooms,
pushing the friend of her girlhood playfully before
her with her forefinger pressed into the small of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
back, until they reached the open door and entered
the main rooms.</p>

<p>The music of Mr. Arthur Worth&#8217;s band rose, a
triumphant tyrant over, the howling talk, when,
during a sharp momentary and calculated pause in
the tornado of violins came the loud and unexpected
crash of some heavy object falling violently in the
hall below. Mary Smith moved very rapidly and
silently downstairs towards the sound.</p>

<p>It was as she expected; George Mulross had come!
A little flushed and very much annoyed, he had upset
the Great Stuffed Bear which stood near the door
of the house. George was looking at the Prostrate
Monster with angry defiance, and nothing but his
dignity forbade him to attempt to raise it. The
accident was enough to decide Mary. She dreaded
the impression Dolly might receive if the poor lad
went up now and was flurried again. She went up
and put her hand on his shoulder as he stood there.
He jumped round and discovered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Lord!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy,&#8221; she commanded firmly, &#8220;go out at
once. A great deal depends on it. Go out at once.
Don&#8217;t wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to say something about his wife and a
carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Go out at once!</i>&#8221; said Mary Smith.</p>

<p>He tried to say something about his hat and coat.</p>

<p>Some yards before them at the open door the
noise of a carriage was heard and there were servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
waiting. Behind them more servants. But Mary
Smith knew her world.</p>

<p>It was a choice of evils, and George Mulross
Demaine went out into the night, hatless and coatless.
The policemen were pleased to see such familiarity
among the great. They doubted not that the gentleman
was taking the air, but they wondered why he
walked so very rapidly eastward through Mayfair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from the carriage the daughter of
Theocritus C. Benson came out, not without decision,
and very soon the rooms of that house were filled and
even its Moravian music dominated by the acuteness
of her laugh and the tremendous decision of her tread.</p>

<p>When every one had gone, one hat and coat
remained. The footman pawned them: they were
those of George Mulross Demaine.</p>

<p>He, poor fellow, saw in all this nothing but that
eternity of bad luck to which he was born. When
his wife asked him next day why he had left the
Petheringtons&#8217; so early, he told some ordinary lie:
he had left indeed because one wiser than he had
told him to leave, but he could make neither head
nor tail of the whole affair: and his foot hurt him
where the Bear had crushed it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">EASTER, as those who survive will know, fell
early in 1915&mdash;to be exact, upon April 4th;
Ole Man Benson had returned on the 11th; on the
12th Mary had seen Dolly; and the week after Ole
Man Benson&#8217;s return to these shores, the week after he
had delivered his important and somewhat depressing
news to the young household, the week after
Mary and Dolly had conferred at the Petheringtons&#8217;&mdash;was
the week in which Parliament met after the
Recess, the third week in April.</p>

<p>In that week also there began to crop up here
and there unexpectedly, beautifully, like the spring
flowers, short newspaper notes upon George Mulross
Demaine.</p>

<p>They were notes of where he had been, whether
he had been there or not,&mdash;at least at first they were
notes of that kind. There had always been some
such notes on him in the papers, but they seemed
to be getting numerous.</p>

<p>The public would hear that George Mulross loved
his great poodle dog; next that the pressure of his
engagements forbade him to open an Enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Institution for the Cultivation and Study of Virulent
Diseases, and in connection with this news the
Institution was described at great length, and the
passionate regrets at the absence of George Mulross
Demaine sounded like a small but perceptible dirge
in the corners of the daily press.</p>

<p>He was attacked gently but cleverly in a paper
upon his own side of politics; short biographical
notes, only a few among several score, gave details
of his happy little ways. He was fond of riding, said
one author who can have had but little intimacy with
her subject; he was fond of children, said another
who had even less. He had &#8220;an eye for black game,&#8221;
said a third, whose lack of intimacy included not
only George himself but certainly black game as
well.</p>

<p>Later came anecdotes of his goodness of heart;
how he had run over a boy in the Park with his
motor and had then picked him up; and how he
had good-humouredly refrained from telling people
who he was in the railway accident, and had permitted
the wounded to be taken to hospital before he himself
would accept conveyance.</p>

<p>Finally, as the month ended, and as May brought
in the London season, George Mulross began to find
himself uncomfortably prominent. For he very
sincerely and very heartily hated fame. He could
not so much as upset a glass of wine or stumble
over public stairs without hearing his name whispered;
and once when he had called at the wrong number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the servant, recognising him from some caricature in
the papers, had mentioned his own name to him with
reverence, though the door was the door of a house
whose occupants he did not know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tiny balance at the bank had gone.
The overdraft was large and at any moment there
might come a note which he dreaded. And Mary
Smith had compelled him to look for a small house
in Westminster and to make every preparation for
leaving Demaine House. He kicked feebly, but
she insisted: and even Sudie gave way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t enough to keep the house dry,&#8221; Mary
said. And she compelled them both to a sense of
business which Theocritus himself would have failed
to make them feel.</p>

<p>All this business was well advanced when Mary
Smith proceeded to the next stage of the campaign.</p>

<p>She carefully looked up the nature of the Court of
Dowry, and when she had learned all that she could
learn from her books (it took her half a day&mdash;though
she was a woman of exceptional intelligence and
excellent education) she set herself to learn all that
could be learned from living men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Court of Dowry, in its very survival and still
more perhaps in the functions to-day attached to it,
affords an admirable example of the value of fixed
institutions in the life of a people.</p>

<p>It was originally instituted to try cases falling
within the jurisdiction of that Queen Mother of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Middle Ages to whom the poet Gray so pathetically
alludes in the striking lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;She-wolf of France with unrelenting fangs</div>
<div class="verse">Tearing the bowels,&#8221; etc.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It had cognizance of all Escheats, Novels Tabulate
and Malprisions Reguardaunt in the County of
Ponthieu and the Seniory of Lucq. But when active
jurisdiction over these continental territories was
interrupted under King Henry <small>VI.</small>, there remained
no function for the Court but the trial of cases arising
in or without foreign ports upon decks subject to the
Crown of England.</p>

<p>It lingered thus into the beginning of the sixteenth
century, at which moment it was reduced to a Clerk
known as the <i>Mangeur</i>, and a Warden, each holding
what were virtually sinecures (and not highly paid
sinecures at that) about the Palace.</p>

<p>Henry <small>VIII.</small>, whom we cannot call a good but
whom surely we may call a great man, rudely
suppressed the office of Mangeur with a cruel jest
at the executioner&#8217;s expense, and only permitted the
Wardenship itself to survive on the strict understanding
that the salary should be paid to himself.
The title, however, remained, a minor distinction
among the numerous baubles of the time, and was,
if I may so express it, resurrected from obscurity by
the great family of Heygate at the moment of the
Restoration of Charles <small>II.</small></p>

<p>In their gladness at their recovery of a legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sovereign, this dominant house (now represented by
the Parrells) trapped themselves in every accoutrement
of joy, and, among other posts, the Wardenship
of the Court of Dowry was voted in 1661 an annual
salary of £2000, for which sum held by the same Act
as an hereditary right, the head of the House of
Heygate was content to license the annual holding
of the Court within the Royal Manor and Liberties
of Tooting.</p>

<p>At first this Court sat for one full day in each year&mdash;St.
Luke&#8217;s&mdash;but later, from 1731, this session was
maintained in fiction alone. A crier in Westminster
Hall, at the opening of every Hilary Term, would
rapidly read out a list of three fictitious cases which
went by default, claim seventeen and sixpence, and
for ever after hold his peace.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the fixed yearly salary
of £2000 hereditarily enjoyed by the Heygate family
steadily grew, till, by the time of the Reform Bill, it
had reached the very considerable sum of £15,000,
still payable to the Heygates though now all vestige
of activity in the office had disappeared.</p>

<p>Our grandfathers, in the zeal of that somewhat
iconoclastic moment, swept away the corrupt figment.
The emoluments of the post were ruthlessly cut
down to the original £2000; its hereditary character
was, after a violent debate in the House of Lords,
destroyed by a majority of over fifty votes, determined
(as were so many of the great changes of that
time!) by the voice of Eldon. The Detainer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
office (for such was his official title) received in
compensation a lump sum of half a million only&mdash;not
twenty years&#8217; purchase&mdash;and certain apparently
unimportant functions were attached to the place
which from that day forward became an appointment
changing with the Administration.</p>

<p>Mark here the silent virtue of organic constitutional
growth, and how a gentry can find it possible to create
where demagogues would have destroyed.</p>

<p>Point by point and function by function, one
marine interest after another attached itself to the
Court of Dowry as the beautiful organisms of the
sea attach themselves to the ships that plough its
waters, until there had grown up round the Court of
Dowry by the end of the nineteenth century so considerable
a mass of precedent and custom and, with
the vast extension of our maritime commerce, duties
so manifold and of such moment to the nation, that
the office re-emerged after its life of six centuries,
an organ of capital importance in the workings of
English Government.</p>

<p>As must be the case in any old and secure State,
certain anomalous duties were further attached to it:
the inspection of patent medicines for instance, the
giving out of contracts for buoys and rockets, and
the formal stamping of licences to sell sarsaparilla.
Even so the wretched and insufficient salary of
£2000 remained the sole remuneration of the
Warden, though the great name of GHERKIN had
raised it to be among the foremost posts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Cabinet, and it had since seen the brilliancy, the
learning and the judgment respectively of a Dibley, a
Powker and a Hump. By 1912 its strict control over
the great steamship lines, its supervision of wrecks,
derelicts, Hunnage, Mixings, and Ports Consequent,
made it second only to the Foreign Office in the
matter of public interest, and, like the Foreign Office,
largely removed from the wranglings of party.</p>

<p>Some months later the salary was raised, amid the
cheers (as I have said) of a united House, to £5000
a year, with a further allowance of £5000 for the
expenses of entertainment and travel, which fall
with peculiar severity upon this great Department;
and in the hands of Charles Repton it had risen to
be something even more, if that were possible, than
GHERKIN had made it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much did Mary Smith discover: partly in what
she already knew, partly in her reading. The living
voices of men told her further things.</p>

<p>It seemed that in the dingy offices which (by a
lovely trait in the character of politics!) house this
great Department&mdash;they stand between Parliament
Street and New Scotland Yard&mdash;a certain Mr. Sorrel
had for now seven years exercised his marvellous
and hidden powers, and while all were prepared to
admit the genius of Charles Repton, those who best
knew the workings of a great Government office,
spoke almost as though Mr. Sorrel were in himself
the Court of Dowry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>The quaint customs attaching to the office of
Warden, the little bells upon the shoes, the bearing
of a model ship, bareheaded, upon Empire Day (a
recent innovation and one awkward only to the bald
or the blind), though to some they seemed a drawback,
to others were but an additional attraction, and
the ceremony of waggling in backwards upon all fours
into the presence of the Sovereign at Inauguration,
had been, with perhaps doubtful wisdom, abolished,
to suit the eccentric Radicalism of GHERKIN, who
refused to take office under any other condition.</p>

<p>The Accolade, or Ceremonial Stroke, however,
heavily administered with a beam of ebony across the
back of the Warden Accept, was retained and has
often afforded a subject for illustration and archæological
research.</p>

<p>Mary Smith learnt even more. She learnt that
while decency forbade any saving to be effected
on the further £5000 that was an allowance for entertainment
and travel, yet custom allowed it to be
spent in all forms of hospitality, and that travel
might include such social visits as were necessary to
the occupant of so high an office. When she learnt
this she was but the more confirmed in her determination
that Charles Repton who for the moment
encumbered the post of Warden, should accept a
barony, and that quickly; for she saw the agony of
Demaine House already begun. Upon a certain
morning in the mid-week of May the last stage of
her beneficent action was ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his study on that same morning, Charles Repton,
a little weary but with all his action planned and
designed, suffered again for a moment that slight dull
pain behind the ears, where Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia are: he
was dazed. He went out and sought his wife, and she
was astonished to see as he put to her some simple
question on the management of the household, a
look of innocence in his eyes. It quickly faded. The
pain also departed, and he returned to his study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mary Smith sent a note over to Demaine House.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s note found George Mulross Demaine risen
after a lonely lunch and wondering, as he regularly
wondered every day, what was going to turn up.</p>

<p>His wonderment had bewilderment in it also.
Something was going to turn up he knew ...
people were noticing him so. Only last evening
there was a savage attack upon him in the <i>Moon</i>,
saying that he had torn Hares to pieces with his own
reeking hands, and killed a Carted Stag with a blunt
knife; while the <i>Capon</i>, with more truth, had pointed
out the beauty of the Sir Joshuas in his house, but
had erroneously suggested that they were heirlooms
in his family.</p>

<p>He was still gazing at the May morning and
gloomily considering the buds in the formal garden,
when Mary&#8217;s note was forced upon him by a huge
Dependant.</p>

<p>A note in the firm hand of Mary Smith was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
always a pleasant thing to get; for a bewildered
man it had something in it of salvation.</p>

<p>George Mulross went in a mood lighter than any
he had known for many weeks, towards his cousin&#8217;s
house. He found her, of course, alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy,&#8221; she said, lifting his hand gently from
the chimneypiece where he was moving it aimlessly
among several breakable and valuable things,&mdash;&#8220;Dimmy,
when did you last ask a question in the
House?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked frightened, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! ages ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Dimmy,&#8221; she said smoothly, &#8220;I
want you to go and ask this to-day,&#8221;&mdash;and she
handed him a bit of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got any money in it?&#8221; he asked
innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You silly
ass! What could that have to do with it? Read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He read: &#8220;<i>Mr. G. M. Demaine: to ask the Prime
Minister whether his attention has been called to the
fact that the Van Huren Company is not registered
in London as the law provides, and what steps he
proposes to take in view of this evasion of a public
safeguard?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth have I to do with that?&#8221; he
asked, looking up at her, a little put out and evidently
unwilling to take any risks. &#8220;What is it anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Dimmy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do be a good
fellow: it&#8217;s all for your good.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;Well anyhow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get an answer
for two days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes you can,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve sent Dolly a little
note typewritten, and signed it in your name; and
you can call it a &#8216;matter of which you have given
him private notice.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you have!&#8221; said Demaine, almost moved
to energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; said Mary Smith firmly. &#8220;There
are a hundred and eight questions to-day; it&#8217;s half-past
three and you&#8217;ve time to get down to the
House comfortably. I&#8217;ll take you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did: and amid the general indifference of
most members in a crowded House, the amusement
of perhaps a couple of dozen, and the red-hot silent
rage of at least two, G. M. Demaine in a half-audible
voice, mumbled his query.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister received more than a murmur
of applause when he answered in his clear and rather
high voice that in a matter of such importance and
in a moment such as this, it was not to the interest
of the country to give a public reply.</p>

<p>If there was one thing George Mulross Demaine
dreaded more than another it was to be questioned,
and still more to be congratulated, upon things he
did not understand. Luckily for him a scene of
some violence connected with the religious differences
of the Scotch, prevented the immediate
opening of the debate at the end of Questions, and
he had the opportunity to slip away. But to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
terror he found the motor waiting for him and
Mary Smith beckoning him from within; like the
fascinated bird of the legend he was captured. He
hoped that she would drive him to some more
congenial air. But no, she produced, from a large
and business-like wallet which she only carried in
her most imperious moments, two questions to be
set down for the day after the morrow.</p>

<p>He took them with a groan and yielded as yield
he must to her command that he should set them
down. They were of no importance, the one was
to his uncle by a second marriage, the First Civil
Lord, to ask him the name of a Company that had
proved less able than was expected in the manufacture
of armour plates; the other to his cousin
the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking if the
action of some obscure servant of the Treasury in
a peaceful Buckinghamshire village had received the
attention which his recent services seemed to require.</p>

<p>The day and hour came round. George Mulross
in a voice perhaps a little more assured than that
of two days before, said when his turn came:
&#8220;Twenty-nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his surprise the Chancellor of the Exchequer
answered with some tartness that he had nothing
whatever to add to his predecessor&#8217;s answer of
July 9th ten years before, and added amid general
approval, that insinuations such as were those contained
in the question were greatly to be deplored.</p>

<p>A man of excitable temperament had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
leapt to his feet to ask a supplementary question
when he was sharply checked by the Chair and the
curious incident closed.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes passed and once again, sweating
with fear, Demaine heard his name called out and
said in a voice still audible: &#8220;Fifty-four.&mdash;I mean
Forty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>The First Lord of the Admiralty rose solemnly
in all the dignity of his great white beard, adjusted
his spectacles, looked fully at the intruder upon his
peace, and said with his unmistakable accent, that
the name of the Company could be dithcovered
through the ordinary thourceth of information.</p>

<p>So the game continued for ten days. In vain did
his friends assure him that he was losing position
in the House by this perpetual pose of the puritan
and the sleuth hound. Mary Smith was a woman
who must be obeyed, and of twenty-three questions
which she put into his unwilling lips at least one
had gone home. And the First Lord of the
Admiralty in the same dignity of the same white
beard and with the same striking accent, had
admitted the nethethity of thtriking from the litht
of contractorth the name of the firm of which, until
that moment, the unhappy George Mulross had
never even heard.</p>

<p>He knew, he felt, that he, the most blameless of
men, was making enemies upon every side. The
allusions to his public spirit which were now occasionally
to be discovered in the Opposition papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the little bitter sentences in those which were upon
the contrary subsidised by his own party, filled him
with an equal dread.</p>

<p>He was in no mood for going further, when upon
the top of all this Mary Smith quietly insisted that
he must make a speech.</p>

<p>It need not be long: she would write it out for
him herself. He must learn it absolutely by heart
and must take the greatest care to pronounce the
words accurately. She chose a debate in which he
could talk more or less at large and put before
him as gentle, as well reasoned, as terse and as
broad-minded a piece of wisdom as the House might
have listened to for many months.</p>

<p>Morning and afternoon, a patient governess, Mary
Smith heard him recite that speech; but as day
succeeded day she slowly determined that it wouldn&#8217;t
do. One slip might be his ruin. Upon the
tenth rehearsal he still said &#8220;very precious&#8221; for
&#8220;meretricious.&#8221; He was still unable to restrain a
sharp forward movement at the words &#8220;I will go
a step further&#8221;; and he could never get in its
right order the simple phrase: &#8220;I yield to no one in
my admiration for the right honourable gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>First he would yield to a right honourable gentleman;
then no one would yield to him; then he
would yield to no admiration, and at last she gave
it up in despair.</p>

<p>A woman of less tenacity would have abandoned
her design; not so Mary Smith. She discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with careful art that there was no reason why a
Warden of the Court of Dowry should speak in the
House at all; he might hold his post for three years
and do no more than answer questions, leaving to a
subordinate the duty of speaking upon those very
rare public Bills, which, however distantly, concerned
his office.</p>

<p>She had already made him a name; she was
determined not to destroy it by following up this
false scent of training him to public speaking. At
last, as the month of May was drawing to a close,
she determined to put him upon the rails.</p>

<p>Dolly and she were agreed. Perhaps Dimmy
would need to be persuaded; he was naturally
modest, and what was more he would very certainly
be afraid, but still more certainly he wanted money
most abominably.</p>

<p>When the day came for him to receive his great
illumination she called him to her once more, and
once more he found her alone. She lunched him
first, and gave him a wine of which she knew he
could drink in moderation, for she felt he would need
courage; she let him drink his coffee, she lit her own
tiny cigar, and at last she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy, what does it take you to live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dimmy with some terror in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Mary Smith looked at him a little quizzically. He
did not like those looks though he was fond of her.
It made him feel like an animal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Dimmy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;could you and Sudie
manage it on seven thousand a year, or say on six
thousand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dimmy thought long and painfully. For him
there were but two scales of income, the poor and
the rich. In the days when it was such a bore to
raise a sovereign, he was poor. For nearly two years
with an unlimited capital behind him, and about
twenty thousand a year for his wife to spend, he had
considered himself positively and fixedly among the
rich. He had felt comfortable: he had had elbow
room. Six thousand pounds puzzled him: it was
neither one thing nor the other. A brilliant thought
struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me, Mary,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;some
one who has got about six thousand? I think I
could judge <i>then</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you one positively,&#8221; said Mary Smith.
&#8220;Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife. Till the old Yid
dies they&#8217;ve got six thousand exactly. I ought to
know, considering that I went over every scrap of
paper in order to make sure of Charlie repaying me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Demaine judicially. &#8220;Charlie Fitzgerald
and his wife....&#8221; He thought for a long
time. &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re pretty comfortable,&#8221; he said
suddenly. &#8220;Of course they haven&#8217;t got a place
and grounds; I suppose if they had a place and
grounds they couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;but the house in Westminster
is very large when you get inside through the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
part. When are you going into Westminster,
Dimmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dimmy hopelessly. &#8220;Sudie&#8217;s
got all muddled about it. She saw &#8216;City of Westminster&#8217;
stuck up on one of those khaki Dreadnought
hats that the street sweepers wear, an&#8217; the
man was getting horrors into a cart right up by
our house, an&#8217; she said that where we <i>were</i> was
Westminster anyhow. And then when I argued
with her she shoved me to the window and pointed
out his hat. She was quite rough.&#8221; And George
Mulross sighed.</p>

<p>Mary Smith got testy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk rubbish,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and don&#8217;t bother me about your wife.
Have you looked at anything in Westminster at
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Demaine humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know,&#8221; said Mary sharply, and with a
strong inclination to slap him. &#8220;Have you looked
in Dean&#8217;s Yard, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Demaine, slowly reviewing his perambulations
of the last few days. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve looked
at Dean&#8217;s Yard. There&#8217;s nothing there.... All the
rest seems to be so slummy, Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some exceedingly good new houses,&#8221;
said Mary severely, &#8220;and everybody&#8217;s going there;
and the old houses are perfectly delicious. Anyhow,
Westminster&#8217;s the place; and I&#8217;ll tell you something
else. You&#8217;ve got to take office!&#8221;</p>

<p>George Mulross, worried as he always was when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
she began drilling him, on hearing the word &#8220;office&#8221;
said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I won&#8217;t, that&#8217;s flat. I don&#8217;t believe in it.
I&#8217;ve seen lots of men do that kind of thing. They
get to the City and they think they&#8217;re learning
business, and they&#8217;re rooked before....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;TAKE office&#8217;!&#8221; shouted Mary Smith,
&#8220;TAKE office&mdash;get a post.... Dolly will give you
a post. Now do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Demaine vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy,&#8221; she said more quietly but with great
firmness, &#8220;look at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her. It was a muscular strain upon
his eyes to keep them fixed under her superior will.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.... Now listen carefully. The
salary of the Wardenship of the Court of Dowry is
five thousand a year&mdash;and ex&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Demaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Wardenship of the Court of Dowry is
vacant&mdash;if you play up worth tuppence, it&#8217;s yours
for the asking. Do ... you ... understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; repeated George Demaine.</p>

<p>It was as though he had been told that he had
been asleep all these years, that his real name was
Jones and that he lived in Australia, or as though
he had discovered himself to be covered with feathers.
He was utterly at sea. Then he said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Repton&#8217;s Warden of the Court of Dowry.&#8221; He
was proud of knowing this, for he often blundered
about the Cabinet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;Will you or will you not fix your mind upon
what I have said?&#8221; said Mary Smith.</p>

<p>The full absurdity of it grew increasingly upon
Demaine&#8217;s imagination. &#8220;The House would think
Dolly was mad,&#8221; he remarked with really beautiful
humility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Mary Smith in disgust, &#8220;the
House will know nothing about it one way or the
other. The House doesn&#8217;t meddle with government&mdash;thank
God! You&#8217;re popular enough I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Demaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you never speak, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Demaine, &#8220;only once three years ago,
the time I fell down, you know; an&#8217; that was quite
short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many people do you know in the House?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Demaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh NONSENSE!... I mean how many people
would write to you for instance, and congratulate you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Demaine gave it up. But one could see from his
demeanour what she had guessed from her own study
of the debates and from her great knowledge of
London: a month ago people just knew that
Demaine was in the House and that was about all.
They knew him now as a man whose name they had
seen fifty times and who asked questions. A better
candidature could not be conceived, and his close
family connection with so many men on both front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
benches would render the appointment reasonable in
all eyes.</p>

<p>All sorts of things were lumbering against each
other in George Mulross&#8217; brain. He wondered
whether one had to know anything, or what one
had to do, and how the money was paid; and
whether income tax was deducted at source; and
how long the Government would stay in. Then
the absurdity of it recurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there was Pitson,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;and
everybody laughed and said he was a half-wit,&mdash;but
he was in with everybody, although he was a half-wit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t laugh and go about as he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s against a man to laugh much,&#8221; said Mary,
&#8220;and really, if it comes to going about, even a dog
can do that. You&#8217;ve only got to go and sniff round
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation could not profitably be continued.
Demaine had been introduced to the idea,
and that was all Mary desired to do.</p>

<p>She sent him home and invited herself that weekend
to a house in which she would find Dolly: the
Kahns&#8217;&mdash;but no matter. Dolly was there.</p>

<p>When the Prime Minister saw that dear figure of
hers with its promise of importunities he groaned in
spirit. She brought him up to the sticking point
during a long walk on Sunday afternoon, and he
promised her that at least he would sound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know, Mary,&#8221; he said, half trying to
retreat, &#8220;Repton&#8217;s not a man to speak unless he
chooses, and he&#8217;s like a stone wall against one unless
he also chooses to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him walking as I&#8217;m taking you,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, the 31st of May. The weather
had begun to be large and open and warm. He
thought there was something in what she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet him as he comes out of his house to-morrow.
Do you know when he comes out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Prime Minister a little shamefacedly,
&#8220;I do. It&#8217;s always half-past nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t see what your
trouble is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an absurd hour to catch a man, half-past nine&mdash;and
I should have to get up God knows when&mdash;besides
to-morrow&#8217;s a bad day,&#8221; said the Premier,
pressing his lips together when he had spoken. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a bad moment. It&#8217;s a big week for him. He&#8217;s got
a dinner on that&#8217;s something to do with his dam
companies to-morrow evening. I know that. And
then Tuesday he&#8217;s got that big Van Diemens meeting
in the City. And before the end of the week, I
know he&#8217;s talking at the big Wycliffite Conference&mdash;I
can&#8217;t remember the day though. Pottle told me
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had turned to go home, and Mary Smith for
the first hundred yards or so was honestly wondering
in her mind why men found so difficult what women
find so easy.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you what to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Catch him by
accident outside his house as he leaves after breakfast,
then he&#8217;ll walk with you. Say you&#8217;re walking.
Anything can be said when one&#8217;s walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;ll come with me?&#8221; asked the
Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive!&#8221; said Mary Smith in a very quiet tone.</p>

<p>The air was serene above them, and one lark had
found his way so high that they could hardly hear
him singing. The Prime Minister wished from the
bottom of his heart that he could live in that field for
a week. He rose to one despairing rally:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;suppose it rains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Dolly, Dolly, Dolly!&#8221; she answered, stopping
short and standing in front of him. &#8220;It&#8217;s for all the
world as though you were just back from school for
the last time, and I was a little girl who had been
sent for on the grand occasion to tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put both hands on his awkward shoulders to
stop him, and she kissed him anywhere upon the
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t rain, Dolly,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen to that.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">CHARLES REPTON had taken no weekends.
Charles Repton had sat tight in
London.</p>

<p>The end of that May did not tempt him to move;
he was right on to his business, and never had his
silent life been more silent or Maria, Lady Repton,
felt more alone, though she did as she was bid
and remained immovable in her London house,
only seeing, when the leisure was afforded her,
her few dear friends (none conspicuous), and
once or twice presiding at a great dinner of her
husband&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Beyond all his other concerns one chief concern
was resolving itself in Charles Repton&#8217;s head. He
was wondering exactly where he stood between
commerce and politics.</p>

<p>These moments, not of doubt but of a necessity
for decision, are the tests of interior power. Some
half-dozen such moments had marked the career of
his strict soul: one when he had determined to risk
the transition from his native town to Newcastle
carefully calculating the capital of clients and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
much could be successfully lent in that centre:
another, when he had risked the expense of his
first election: a third when he had decided to
take office&mdash;and there were others.</p>

<p>Now as May drew to its close, as the discussion
on the Budget was in full swing and as the eager
public notice of Van Diemens was on the point
of filling the press, he was in some balance as to
whether the precise proportion of activity which he
gave to the House of Commons&mdash;it was a large
proportion&mdash;might not be absorbing just too much
of his energy.</p>

<p>He calculated most exactly&mdash;as a man calculates
a measurable thing, an acreage, or a weight of metal&mdash;what
the future proportions should be.</p>

<p>He must remain in touch with everything that
passed at Westminster; on that he was fixed. But
he knew that there was a growing criticism of his
combination of high political idealism with affairs
in the City. The <i>Moon</i> had said one exceedingly
unpleasant thing about the Oil Concession in
Burmah&mdash;it was only a newspaper but he had had
to settle it. The <i>Capon</i> was paying a little more
attention than he liked to his position in the House
of Commons.</p>

<p>He thought hard, and under the process of his
thought his mind somewhat cleared. But he had
come to no decision when, late in the night of
Sunday, the 31st of May, he marshalled the papers
upon his desk, deliberately turned his mind off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
problems that had been engaging him, and drew up
a list of his next engagements.</p>

<p>The next day, Monday the 1st of June, after leaving
his house punctually at half-past nine, he was to
give half the morning to the Wardenship. He was
to return home at noon. From noon to lunch he
must see to his accounts. It was doubly important,
for it was a Monday and it was the first of the
month. He would lunch: preferably alone, for he
would be tired, and he would give Maria to understand
that he must be undisturbed.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 2nd, was the speech to the
General Meeting of Van Diemens. He glanced at
his notes for that speech; they were all in excellent
sequence, and he felt, so far as men of that stern
temper can feel it, a little touch of pride when he
noted the procession of the argument. He saw in
his mind&#8217;s eye first the conviction and then the
enthusiasm of the men whom he must convince: the
vivid portrayal of the Empire&#8217;s need of the railway:
the ease of building it,&mdash;the delivery of the great
metaphor wherein he compared that thin new line of
iron to the electrical connection which turns potential
and useless electrical energy into actual and working
force.</p>

<p>He re-read the phrase in which he called it
&#8220;completing the circuit&#8221;; he did not doubt at all
that the meeting would follow him. Sentence after
sentence passed before his memory (for he had
carefully learned the peroration by heart); the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of Nelson shone in one of them, the name of Rhodes
in another, of Joel in a third, till the great oration
closed with a vision, brief, succinct (but how vivid!)
of the Gate of the East and of England&#8217;s hand upon
it, holding</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">&#8220;... the keys</div>
<div class="verse">Of such teeming destinies&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>through them: through them!</p>

<p>It was a great speech.</p>

<p>He turned more carelessly to the already typewritten
stuff which he must deliver upon the
Thursday to the Wycliffite Conference. It would
do&mdash;and it was of importance for the moment. It
reminded him a little contemptuously of the High
Meat Teas in the North of England and of his
youth, and of that maundering war between Church
and Chapel which was then of real moment to him,
and which now he still had wearily to wage,&mdash;at least
in public.</p>

<p>Whether this little bout of study had been too
much for a man who had already spent a full month
glued to his work, or whatever else was the cause, he
felt as midnight approached a trifle brain-sick. He
leant his head upon his hand, and it seemed to him&mdash;he
hoped it was an illusion for the sensation was
yet vague&mdash;but it <i>did</i> seem to him that the pain
behind the ears, or at least an oppression there, was
beginning. He muttered an exclamation so sharp as
would have astonished those who had never seen him
under a strain. Then he went quickly upstairs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
drawing-room and found his wife, sitting all alone
with her book.</p>

<p>She looked up as he entered, and again she was
startled by that strange innocence in his eyes. Odd,
(but what living!) flashes of thirty, of forty years ago
pierced her heart. Youth goes down every lane, and
these two, just after their marriage, just before the
first loan he had made, had been, for a month or so,
young: the memory of it was a jewel to her.</p>

<p>He came in at that instant loosened: he was
walking ill: he made towards her as though he were
seeking a refuge, and still that persistent innocence
shone from his eyes. He sat down beside her,
breathing uncertainly, groped out and took her
hand. He had made no such movement since&mdash;what
year? Since before what first hardening had
frightened her? How many years, how long a life
ago?</p>

<p>The mood was of no long duration. She could
have wished it had been longer. He slept with a
sort of deep lethargy that was not his way, and twice
in the night she rose to watch him; but with the
morning all his powers and, alas! all that difference
had returned.</p>

<p>She was to see nothing of him while he went
through every detail of his affairs for the week and
the month with his assistant; she was not even to
be allowed to see something of him at his midday
meal; she watched him as he went out of the house
at the invariable hour to drive to the office of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Court of Dowry. And as she watched him with new
feelings in her, and the breaking of dead crusts, she
saw another man accost him, the cab turned away,
and the two go together, walking, towards the Park.
She knew the figure though she came so little into
the life of London, and she recognised, in the sloppy
clothes and the stooping walk, the Prime Minister.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you are a member of the governing classes
of this great Empire it is not an easy thing to
approach a house between the Edgware Road and
Hyde Park from the North, at half-past nine in the
morning it is supremely difficult if you are making
for Westminster.</p>

<p>It presupposes being carted at an impossible hour
to some place in the North West, and there let loose
and making a run for home. And why should any
man of position be carted to any place in the North
West at dawn? On the whole the best excuse is
Paddington Station. Eton is a good place to come
from, for the liar comes in at Paddington. It was from
Eton, therefore, that the Prime Minister came that
morning ... anyhow he was N.W. of the Park before
nine. He walked slowly towards the Marble Arch.
As he approached Charles Repton&#8217;s house he walked
somewhat more slowly, but he had timed himself well.</p>

<p>The tall straight figure came out and hailed a cab.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister crossed before him, turned
round in amiable surprise, and said: &#8220;My <i>dear</i>
Repton!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>And Repton greeted, with somewhat less effusion,
the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was walking from Paddington,&#8221; said the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221; said Sir Charles, as he paid
the cabman a shilling for nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I breakfasted before I started. I was
walking down to Westminster. Can&#8217;t you come
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Charles found it perfectly easy, and the two
men walked through the Park together towards Hyde
Park Corner and Constitution Hill.</p>

<p>To most men the difficulty of the transition from
daily converse to important transactions is so difficult
that they will postpone it to the very end of an
interview. The Prime Minister was not of that kind.
They had not got two hundred yards beyond that
large arena near the Marble Arch wherein every
Sunday the Saxon folk thresh out and determine for
ever the antinomy of predestination and free will&mdash;not
to mention other mysteries of the Christian
religion,&mdash;when the Prime Minister had reminded
Charles Repton of the absolute necessity of a new
man on the Government bench in the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>Charles Repton heartily agreed, and for ten
minutes gave his reasons. He hoped, he said in an
iron sort of way, that he was talking sense, and that
he was not meddling with things not his business.
He was warmly encouraged to go on, and he minutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
described the kind of man whom he thought was
wanted. They had too many business men as it
was, and there were too many men fresh from the
House of Commons. The Government forces in the
Upper House had come to be a sort of clique, half
of them very intelligent, but now and then, especially
in big debates, out of touch with their colleagues.
Could not some man of real position, a man with a
long established title, wealthy and thoroughly well
known if only in a small world for some proficiency
of his, be got to take an interest in the Government
programme? A man like Pulborough, for instance?
If Pulborough had had to earn his living he would
have been the best bantam breeder alive. And then,
look at his talents, why, he designed all the new
work at Harberry himself, etc. And so forth.</p>

<p>As they were crossing by the Wellington statue,
the Prime Minister, in the uneasy intervals of dodging
the petrol traffic, explained that that was not in his
mind. He must have some one who had heard
everything in the Cabinet for the last two years.
&#8220;Repton,&#8221; he said ... (as they left the refuge
pavement&mdash;a taxi-cab all but killed him).... &#8220;Repton,
would you, have you thought of ....&#8221; Two gigantic
motor-buses swerved together and the politicians were
separated. The Prime Minister saw the Warden far
ahead, a successful man, whole upon the further shore.
The Prime Minister leapt in front of a bicycle, caught
the kerb and ended his sentence &#8220;... a peerage
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>They had come through all the perils of that space
and were walking quietly down Constitution Hill;
Dolly could develop his thought more freely, and in
the most natural way in the world he put it that they
could not do without Charles Repton.</p>

<p>He was very careful not to force the position.
Charles Repton was absolutely essential: they must
have him or they must have nobody.</p>

<p>An Egyptian smile, a smile of granite, could be
guessed rather than seen upon Charles Repton&#8217;s firm
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you propose that I should be Master of
the Horse?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, smiling very much
more easily, &#8220;nor Manager of the King&#8217;s Thoroughbred
Stud, either. But I know that Abenford is
mortally tired of the Household; though what there
is to be tired of,&#8221; he added....</p>

<p>To the Prime Minister&#8217;s very great surprise, Charles
Repton simply replied: &#8220;If I went to the Lords, I
should go without office.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this unexpected solution the Prime Minister
was in duty bound to propose a hundred reasons
against it. He implored Repton to remember his
great position and the peculiar value that he had for
him, the Prime Minister. &#8220;It&#8217;s never more than
three men that do the work, Repton, whether you&#8217;re
dealing with ten in committee or half a thousand.
You know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Charles Repton was firm. These solid masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of finance are glad to think out their world; in a
sense nothing comes to them that is unexpected when
it comes. Their brains may be compared to the
great new War Office in Whitehall, where a hundred
minutely detailed plans for the invasion of Germany,
France, Russia, Spain, Italy and the Baltic States,
lie pigeonholed, in perfect order, ready to be put into
immediate execution at the pronouncement of the
stern words <i>Krieg-mobil</i>.</p>

<p>Long before the simple intrigues of the drawing-rooms
had taken shape, Charles Repton had swept
the whole landscape with his inward eye. He knew
every fold of the terrain, he had measured every
range. He had determined that, upon the whole,
a peerage was worth his while: now; at the very
height of his fortune.</p>

<p>To have a permanent place, free from office, with
the prestige of title, with committees open to him
and every official source permanently to his hand,
was worth his while. It was worth his while to go to
the House of Lords had it been a matter for his free
choice; and if he went to the House of Lords he
must go a free man. It would do more to save
Van Diemens than any other step, and that great
Company was worth twenty places in the Cabinet.
Van Diemens was the master of this Cabinet and
the last.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind then that a peerage
was worth his while even if it depended entirely on
his choice. Now that he could make it a favour, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was doubly worth his while. The alternative meant
useless friction.... Yes, he would take that peerage:
but there was one thing that he must have quite
clear:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The two men walked together in silence past the
Palace; they went through the superb new entrance
to St. James&#8217;s Park, crossed the bridge, and turned
towards Westminster.</p>

<p>It had been a shock. The relief for the Prime
Minister was somewhat too great, and the last thing
that Repton had to say was awkward; but he was
accustomed to leap such hedges. He began boldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know what I have set aside
for the regular purposes of the Party?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister shook his head. If there was
one thing he detested, it was the kitchen side of
politics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said Repton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve put
exactly the same sum aside every year for fifteen
years, whether we&#8217;ve been in office or out of it. Not
a large sum, only five hundred pounds. Pottle will tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier made such a movement with his head
as showed that he did not care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only five hundred pounds but exactly five
hundred pounds,&#8221; continued Repton firmly. &#8220;Now
Pottle must understand quite clearly that that subscription
will neither be increased nor diminished.&#8221;
He spoke as men speak in a shop, and in a shop of
which they have the whip hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s between you and Pottle,&#8221; said the Prime
Minister in the tone of one who doesn&#8217;t want to go
on with the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Repton, looking straight in front of
him, &#8220;it <i>has</i> got to be understood quite clearly. I&#8217;ve
made it a standing order. Pottle&#8217;s never pestered
me, but he <i>can</i> pester like the deuce.... And I&#8217;ve
absolutely made up my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, of course,&#8221; said the Prime Minister.
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s wise,&#8221; he went on,&mdash;&#8220;It isn&#8217;t my business,
but I do think it wise to keep in touch with the
Central Office. But it&#8217;s between you and Pottle.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another long silence as they went down
Great George Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Repton, opposite the Pugin
fountain. The two men walked on. The statues of
great men long dead looked down upon them; those
statues were unused to such conversations. One of
the statues must have thought Charles Repton a
tactless fellow, but Charles Repton had calculated
everything, even to his chances of life and to the
number of active years that probably lay before him.
And nothing would have more offended or disturbed
him than any ambiguity upon the business side of
the transaction.</p>

<p>They parted, one for the Court of Dowry, the other
for Downing Street, and the affair was settled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon the Prime Minister asked Demaine
to come and have a cup of tea. He said he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rather it was in his own room; he took Demaine&#8217;s
arm and led him round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you anything on to-night, Dimmy?&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Dimmy thought. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered
after a long examination of possible engagements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got to be here for the division
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Dimmy. His high record of
divisions was the sheet anchor of his soul: he had
sat up all night sixteen times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Prime Minister hesitating, as
though after all he didn&#8217;t want to drink a cup of
tea, &#8220;you might see me then ... no, come along
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as they drank their tea he told his companion
that there was to be a change in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to leave you perfectly
free.&#8221; He seemed to be suffering a little as he said
it, but he went on tenaciously: &#8220;I want to leave you
perfectly free; ... but of course you know your
name has been put before me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; began Demaine.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister stopped him with his hand.
&#8220;Well, anyhow it <i>has</i>.&#8221; He paused and thought.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell how it would suit you, but I think I can
tell how you would suit it. Now on <i>that</i> point I&#8217;m
satisfied, Dimmy. You know the kind of work
it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Demaine didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, leaning back easily
and joining his hands, &#8220;it&#8217;s like all those things:
you&#8217;ve got your staff ... in one way the work&#8217;s
cut and dried. It&#8217;s very varied work. No man can
be expected to grasp it all round. But,&#8221; (leaning
forward) &#8220;like all these things, it wants a sort of
general point of view, you understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dimmy did not dare to shake his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wants a sort of ...&#8221; the Prime Minister swept
his hand over the table&mdash;&#8220;a sort of what I may call
a&mdash;well, a&mdash;a <i>common sense</i>, especially about sudden
things. You have to decide sometimes.... But
you&#8217;ll soon get into it,&#8221; he added in a tone of relief.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have Sorrel with you all the first few
days; he&#8217;s exceedingly easy to get on with; he&#8217;s
been there for years&mdash;that is, of course, if you
take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Demaine in a whirl, &#8220;yes, if I take it
I shall have Sorrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then of course,&#8221; went on the Prime Minister
rapidly, &#8220;it&#8217;s the kind of place which you can make
anything of. It can count enormously; it counted
enormously under Gherkin until he died. And
Repton of course has made quite a splash in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demaine shuddered slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no necessity,&#8221; continued the other
quickly, &#8220;it&#8217;s really better without a splash. It&#8217;s a
plodding sort of attention that&#8217;s wanted,&#8221; he ended
wearily; then with an afterthought he added: &#8220;Why
not go to Sorrel now?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you give me a note?&#8221; asked Demaine
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh nonsense,&#8221; answered his cousin, upon whom
the strain was beginning to tell. &#8220;Just go up and
see him in his office. He&#8217;s the mildest of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Demaine sighing. He finished
his tea and went out,&mdash;and as he left the Prime
Minister called after him: &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to find me
after the division to-night. Then I can tell you if
anything is settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demaine walked undeterminedly towards the
Dowry Offices behind Scotland Yard; his heart
failed him; he did not go in. He stood aimlessly
in Whitehall, staring at the traffic; his knees were
not quite straight and his mouth was half open.</p>

<p>Past him, as he so stood, strode, full of vigour and
of will, the fixed form of Sir Charles Repton, walking
towards Trafalgar Square. The younger man
followed him with his eyes and felt in his heart
what a gulf there was between them. He was by
no means of those who dare, and the thought of
office appalled him. Then suddenly he remembered
the salary. His legs straightened beneath him and
he forced himself up the stairs to where he might
ask to see Mr. Sorrel.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SIR CHARLES REPTON strode up Whitehall.
His day&#8217;s work had been heavy, in the hours
since that morning conversation, and he was suffering.</p>

<p>It was no spiritual suffering which affected that
strong character: his life was fixed; the decision
he had taken was final. Nay, every circumstance
surrounding that decision delighted him. The
peerage had been offered at precisely the right
moment; he himself could have chosen no better. It
was the moment when he particularly desired to be
at once more powerful, if that could be, and yet free;
more fixed in his political tenure, yet more at large
to catch the hand of opportunity. For all his
strategy was centred upon the Company which he
was determined to save.</p>

<p>That from which he now suffered was physical; he
suffered that pain at the back of the head: it had
a novel intensity about it; it was not exactly a
headache, it was a sort of weight, an oppression, and
as he went on northward the pressure got worse and
more concentrated just behind either ear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>He would not relax his pace. He saw a taxi
which had just discharged a fare at Cox&#8217;s Bank; in
spite of the trouble in his head which was rapidly
increasing, he was clear enough to note that the little
flag was up, that the man was free and was about to
go away. He signalled to him and got in, and gave
the address of his house, bidding him call at the Club
on his way.</p>

<p>He remembered, though the bother was getting
worse, that there was a big dinner that evening; he
tried to remember the names, then quite suddenly a
stab of pain behind the right ear almost made him
cry out. But Repton was indomitable and he stifled
the cry. Hardly had he so conquered himself when
he felt another similar violent agony behind the left
ear: a man less master of himself would have fainted.
It was over in a moment, but he was white and
actually uncertain of his steps when he got out at the
Club and went up to the porter&#8217;s box to ask for
letters and messages. There were none.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you certain there are none?&#8221; he asked in a
weak voice.</p>

<p>That query was so unusual from the man that the
porter looked up surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me as though I was stuffed,&#8221; said
Sir Charles sharply, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know what your
place is worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man grumbled a little.</p>

<p>With the most unworthy ferocity, but perhaps the
pain must excuse him, Sir Charles bent his head in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to the little window in the glass and hissed: &#8220;This
kind of thing has happened before. Just you bally
well sort the papers in front of you and make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hands were trembling with constricted rage
the porter ran through the bundle, and found a card.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you, you b&mdash;&mdash;y snipe!&#8221; darted
the now uncontrollable Baronet. Then recovering
himself he said with no shame but in a little
confusion:   &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this.&#8221; He looked
at the card: it was an advertisement inviting him to
spend a week for eleven guineas in lovely Lucerne,
and there was a picture of the Rigi Kulm. He tore
the card up savagely, threw it into the waste-paper
basket, hurriedly went down the steps of his Club,
bolted into the taxi and slammed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>The driver had let the engine stop. Sir Charles
sat tapping either foot, his eyes alight, and his hands
working nervously. The man was working the
barrel organ in front of the machine; the piston
started once or twice vigorously, then died down
again. Sir Charles got out.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t make your damn kettle go,&#8221; he said,&mdash;then
he suddenly smiled. &#8220;What a good-natured
face you have,&#8221; he remarked with an abrupt transition
of tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s a brutal thing for men like me with
enormous incomes to bully people who have to be
out in all weathers, though I must say you taxi-men
are a privileged lot! You&#8217;ve always got a herd of
poor fellows round you, running messages for you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
what not. You know,&#8221; he went on still more
familiarly, &#8220;if you didn&#8217;t look so jolly good-natured I
wouldn&#8217;t get into the cab again: but I will now. I
will now,&#8221; he nodded reassuringly to show there was
no ill-feeling, and he climbed again into the taxi,
which at last started off upon its journey.</p>

<p>Sir Charles, within that vehicle, preserved for some
moments the expression of strong silence which was
at least one-half of his fortune. Suddenly that
expression broke down; something tickled him
hugely. Such a merry look came into his eyes as
had perhaps not visited them since he was a child&mdash;if
then. It occurred to him to look out of the
window. The fact that the window was up in no
way incommoded him. He butted his head through
it and then very cautiously drew it in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dangerous,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;might have cut
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver of the taxi heard nothing. Sir Charles
looked through the star of broken glass for a moment,
then cautiously lowered the sash. He put his head
out again, smiling almost to the point of laughter,
and asked the driver whether he had noticed the
absurd pomposity of the two sentries and the
policemen outside Marlborough House. The taxi
man simply said &#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; and went on driving.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Sir Charles was silent, ruminating
and smiling within. Then he put his head
out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but did you?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>And just at that point the traffic was stopped to
allow a cross current from another street to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fool a man can make of himself,&#8221; said
Sir Charles suddenly to nobody, communing half
aloud with his own soul. &#8220;It&#8217;s an amazing thing!
I can&#8217;t conceive why I should put my head out of a
window like that to tell him the way.... I suppose
I was telling him the way ... but my head is so
bad!... What a fool a man can make of himself!&#8221;
The sternness of his expression returned. He remembered
that the taxi-man knew his address and
he bethought him how to escape from humiliation.
When they had driven up to his house he would
pretend it was the wrong number and drive somewhere
else.</p>

<p>Yet again his mood changed and he burst into an
explosion of laughter as he remembered the sentries.
Then the name over a shop which recalled to him
certain mortgages tickled his fancy. He almost
stopped the taxi to get out and have a bout of fun
with the proprietors of that shop but he was going
swiftly through the streets and he preferred his ease.</p>

<p>Long before they reached the Marble Arch he
had forgotten all about his intention of secrecy.
Nay, he had forgotten about his dinner; he only
knew he was going home. And when he got out
he saw upon the little machine the notice &#8220;1/10.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The register marks one and tenpence,&#8221; he said
slowly and gravely to the driver, upon whose honest
and happy face the tendency to astonishment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hardly controlled. &#8220;Now I don&#8217;t think these
machines are infallible&mdash;far from it&mdash;but it isn&#8217;t
worth my while, you understand, to argue it. So
there&#8217;s one and tenpence.&#8221; He laboriously counted
out the money. &#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; he said, &#8220;give
me back three coppers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me back three coppers,&#8221; snapped Sir Charles
testily, &#8220;I want to get rid of a thruppeny-bit,&#8221; and
he handed over the offensive coin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now wait a minute, wait a minute,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;don&#8217;t be in a hurry. I always give a tip to taxi
drivers&mdash;I really don&#8217;t know why,&#8221; he said with a
sudden change of expression, &#8220;there&#8217;s no particular
favour, and they earn lots of money. But one&#8217;s got
to&mdash;I suppose if one didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he continued in a
ruminative tone, &#8220;they&#8217;d mark one in some way,
same way they do the boxes in hotels, and your
watch, me boy, when you pawn it,&#8221; he ended with
an explosion of mirth, digging the man sharply in
the ribs. &#8220;Eh?&#8221; He pulled out two pence, added
another penny, and then another, took out a sixpence,
put it back again, finally put the three pence into the
man&#8217;s hand, and went up to his door.</p>

<p>The taxi-man as he was driving off nodded
familiarly to a policeman, and, by drawing up all
one side of his face while he left the other in repose,
gave it to be understood that he had grave doubts of
the mental balance of the gentleman whom he had
just conveyed to his residence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Alas, for simple men! The policeman strode up
to him, rated him soundly, asked what he meant by
it, and in general gave him to understand that he
was dealing with no ordinary household. And the
taxi-man, who was but recently landed from the
sea, went off pondering, as far as the congested
traffic would allow him, upon the mysteries of
London.</p>

<p>The policeman solemnly returned to his duty,
which was that of guarding the residence of so great
a citizen, and Sir Charles, putting his hat upon the
table in the hall, went past the two servants upon
whose presence in that vestibule he insisted, and
walked majestically up the staircase, as though the
last half-hour had not been.</p>

<p>But he felt during this progress unaccountable
desires. Before he was half-way up they were too
strong for him. He stopped, leaned over the
bannisters, looked at the two well-trained domestics
who stood like statues below him, and said:
&#8220;Henry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry, with a perfect turn of the head, answered,
&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;William!&#8221;</p>

<p>William, with a precisely similar change of attitude,
said, &#8220;Yes, Sir Charles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it feel like to stand like that when
another man, who simply happens to be richer than
you, is going by?&#8221;</p>

<p>The well-trained domestics made no reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&#8220;Are you dumb?&#8221; he shouted angrily. &#8220;What&#8217;s
it feel like, I say?... Blasted fools!&#8221; he muttered,
when he had endured for a few seconds their continued
silence. He went on up the stairs, saying
half to himself and half to them: &#8220;Catch <i>me</i> doing
it. Why, there&#8217;s more money in a whelk stall!&#8221;</p>

<p>He found his wife reading. She put down her
book and asked him timidly what had been going on
in the House.</p>

<p>His only answer was to put his hand to his head
and say that he was suffering.</p>

<p>And so he was, for the pain, though less violent,
had returned. She suggested, though very hesitatingly,
that he should lie down. He made no reply.
He put his hand before his eyes and waited with set
teeth until the first violence of the pang had passed,
and then said to her gently: &#8220;I beg your pardon,
dear, what did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was nearly twenty years since she had heard
that tone from him. She was frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ask what was going on in the House?&#8221; he
sighed. &#8220;Well, I can tell you.&#8221; He put his hands
on the chimneypiece and looked down at the fender.
&#8220;There&#8217;s going on there,&#8221; he said decidedly, &#8220;as
crass, imbecile and hypocritical a piece of futility as
God permits: as Almighty God permits!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Charles!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Charles! Is there any
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, looking round at her with mild
surprise, &#8220;just the usual thing. Nobody has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
slightest idea what they&#8217;re talking about, and nobody
cares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles!&#8221; she said, feeling the gravity of the
moment, for he was evidently suffering in some
mysterious way. &#8220;Have you left it all right in
your room? Haven&#8217;t you any appointments or anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; he answered. His
eyes had in them an expression quite childlike and
he said suddenly: &#8220;One can still see what you were
like when I married you, Maria. Turn your face
round a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did so, with her face full of colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they keep their profiles best.
You can remember them by their profiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles darling,&#8221; said Lady Repton getting up,
her white hair shining against the flush of her
forehead. &#8220;Let me look after you.&#8221; She had not
used such a tone nor dreamed of such an endearment
for many many years.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind, old girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221;
and the innocence of his eyes continued. Then as
though something else were battling within him he
began abruptly: &#8220;Maria, have you got a full list of
the people who are coming to-night? I thought not.
I&#8217;m sorry to have to speak of it again, I told you
when we first came to town, and I&#8217;ve told you fifty
times since, that I can do nothing without such a list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; she said, in great suffering, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got it, Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>His eyes changed again. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The list of the people who are coming, Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ... I didn&#8217;t understand. The list of the
people who are coming,&#8221; he repeated slowly. &#8220;Well,
show it to me in a moment.&#8221; He moved towards
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come with you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>For the first time since her husband had decided
to enter Parliament and had entered it, twenty years
before, while their child was still alive, Lady Repton
had to take a decision of importance. She decided
in favour of the dinner. It was too late to change it,
and she must trust to chance, but evidently some
terrible thing had befallen the Warden of the Court
of Dowry.</p>

<p>As he was dressing she heard him now and then
humming a chance tune (a thing which in his normal
self he would no more have dreamed of doing than of
walking the streets without his hat) and now and
then commenting upon the character and attributes
of the opera singer whom he had last heard sing it.
She heard him launch out into a long monologue,
describing the exact career of the new soprano at
Covent Garden, the name of her father and her
mother, the name of the Russian Grand Duke, the
name of a wealthy English lady who had asked her
(and him) to supper, and then, oh horror! the name
of an English statesman. There was a burst of
laughter which Lady Repton could hardly bear: and
then a silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>When they met again and their guests had begun
to come he seemed right enough, except that now
and then he would say things which every one in the
room knew well enough to be true, but which were
by no means suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p>It was thought eccentric in him, especially by
those who knew him best, that he should comment
somewhat upon what man was paired off with what
woman in the procession, and it was thought exceedingly
coarse by his partner that he should explain a
strong itching upon his right ankle to be due, not to
a flea, for his man was most careful, but to some little
skin trouble.</p>

<p>The noise of talking during the dinner covered
any other indiscretions, and when the men were
alone with him over the wine, he sat gloomily enough,
evidently changed but guilty of nothing more exceptional
than a complete ignorance of where the wine
came from or what it was.</p>

<p>There were the beginnings of a quarrel with a
pompous and little-known fellow-member of his
own Party who attempted to talk learnedly on
wine. Repton had begun, &#8220;What on earth d&#8217;you
know about wine? Why, your old father wouldn&#8217;t
allow you swipes when you went to fetch the
supper beer!&#8221; He had begun thus, I say, to
recall the humble origins of the politician, when he
added: &#8220;But there, what&#8217;s the good of quarreling?
You&#8217;re all the same herd,&#8221;&mdash;his evident illness
excused him. He led them back to the women, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
gloomy troupe; they began to leave uncommonly
early.</p>

<p>The one who lingered last was a very honest man,
stupid, straightforward and rich. He was fond of
Charles Repton, simply because Repton had once
done him a very cheap good turn in the matter of
a legal dispute; he had stopped a lawsuit. And this
man ever, since&mdash;it was now five years ago,&mdash;was
ready to serve that household. His name, I should
add, was Withers, and he was a Commoner; he sat
for Ashington. He had not only this loyal feeling
for Charles Repton, which he was perhaps the only
man in London to feel; he had also a simple admiration
for him, for his career, for his speeches, for his
power of introducing impromptu such words as
&#8220;well,&#8221; and &#8220;now&#8221; and &#8220;I will beg the House to
observe&#8221; into his careful arguments. Lady Repton
trusted him, and she was glad to see him remaining
alone after the others had left. Charles Repton was
sitting at the end of the room, staring at nothingness.</p>

<p>Withers whispered to Lady Repton a rapid query
as to what had happened. She could tell him
nothing, but her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better,&#8221; said Withers hurriedly, in
a low tone, &#8220;if I got him back to vote to-night?
There&#8217;ll be three divisions at eleven. There&#8217;s bound
to be a scandal if he doesn&#8217;t turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;very well,&#8221; said Lady Repton. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t understand it. I don&#8217;t understand anything.&#8221;
She almost broke down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;Repton,&#8221; said Withers, &#8220;won&#8217;t you come along
with me? It&#8217;s half-past ten, there&#8217;ll be three
divisions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Repton startled them both nearly out of their skins.
&#8220;Divisions?&#8221; he shrieked, jumping up. &#8220;Go down
and maunder past those green boxes in a great
stifling pack for nothing at all? Not if I know it!
Why I can guess you the majority from here. And
if there wasn&#8217;t any majority I should blasted well like
to know the difference it would make! Divisions!
Oh chase me!&#8221; And he snorted and sat down again.</p>

<p>Withers did not know whether to stay or to go, but
before he could reply Charles Repton in the most
ordinary of tones went on: &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand a
man like you, Withers, putting up with it. You&#8217;re
rich, you&#8217;re a gentleman born, which I&#8217;m not; you&#8217;d
be just as big a man in Buckinghamshire, especially
nowadays when the county&#8217;s crawling with Jews, if
you were out of the House. You&#8217;d be infinitely freer.
You know perfectly well the country&#8217;ll stagger along
without the silly tom-fool business or with it, and that
neither it nor anything else can prevent the smash.
Why don&#8217;t you go and live your life of a squire like a
sensible chap? And make one prayer that you may
die before the whole bag of tricks comes to an end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Charles,&#8221; said Withers smoothly, &#8220;do
come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221; said Repton, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed. I&#8217;m
tired, and my head hurts me!&#8221; And he went out like
a boor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;Lady Repton,&#8221; said Withers very gently when he
had gone, &#8220;what has Charles got to do to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never tells me,&#8221; said the wretched lady. &#8220;I
suppose he will go into the City as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very unwise,&#8221; said Withers, &#8220;and yet I don&#8217;t
know after all. It might help him to be in harness,
and you&#8217;ll have him out of the house while you&#8217;re
making your plans. I&#8217;ll do what I can, Lady Repton,
I&#8217;ll do what I can. Isn&#8217;t to-morrow the meeting of
the Van Diemens Company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said Lady Repton despairingly. She
was impatient to be seeing to her husband. She had
grown terrified during the last few hours when he was
out of her sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; said Withers. &#8220;Oh that&#8217;ll be all right.
It&#8217;ll do him all the good in the world: I&#8217;m sure it will.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came back again. He remembered something:
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said a little awkwardly, &#8220; I don&#8217;t know
anything about these things, but I read in the paper
that he was down to speak at the big Wycliffite meeting.
Don&#8217;t let him go there, Lady Repton, until
you&#8217;re quite certain, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; she said with the terrified look coming
back again upon her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like business,&#8221; said Withers. &#8220;There&#8217;d be
excitement, you know. Good-night.&#8221; And he went out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Those of Charles Repton&#8217;s guests who were
Members of the House of Commons had returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it. One or two of them had hinted that things were
a little queer with Repton, but Withers when he got
back just in time for the divisions, found no rumours
as yet, and was profoundly grateful. One man only
who had been present at the dinner, took him aside
in the Lobby and asked him whether Charles Repton
had had any trouble.</p>

<p>Withers laughed the question away, and explained
that he had known Repton for many years and that
now and then he did give way to these silly fits of
temper. It was digestion, he said; perhaps the guest
had noticed there were no onions.</p>

<p>The House had something better to gossip about,
for after the divisions Demaine was seen going arm
in arm with the Prime Minister into his room for a
moment. There had been plenty of talk of Demaine
lately: that visit increased it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Certain members more curious or fussy than the
rest scoured the journalists in the lobbies: they had
news.</p>

<p>It was all settled. The paragraphs had been sent
round to the papers. The Lobby correspondents had
each of them quite special and peculiar means of
knowing that Certain Changes were expected in the
Cabinet in the near future; that the House of Lords
was to be strengthened by the addition of talents
which were universally respected; several names had
been mentioned for the vacancy; perhaps Mr.
Demaine, with his special training and the experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
drawn from his travels would, on the whole, form the
most popular appointment.</p>

<p>Thus had the announcement been given in its
vaguest form by the Prime Minister&#8217;s secretary; two
or three favoured journals had been permitted to say
without doubt that Charles Repton had resigned; the
exact title under which he would accept a peerage was
suggested, and Demaine was put down in black and
white as being certainly his successor.</p>

<p>All this Demaine was told meanwhile that evening
in the Prime Minister&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>His interview with Sorrel had been exceedingly
satisfactory, and never in his life, not in the moments
when he could spend most of his father-in-law&#8217;s money,
had Demaine experienced so complete a respect and
so eager a service. He felt himself already Warden,
and what was better, he felt himself perfectly capable
of the Wardenship. His mood rose and rose. He forgot
Sudie; he had not even told her when he would
be home. He shook his cousin&#8217;s hand as warmly as
might a provincial, and went out by the entry under
Big Ben, to calm down the exuberance of his joy
with breaths of the fresh night air along the Embankment.
It was nearly twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>So ended for George Mulross Demaine that
Monday, June 1st, 1915.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Sir Charles Repton woke upon the
Tuesday morning he felt better than he
had felt at any moment since the loss of his
youth. There seemed something easy in the air
about him, and within his mind a lack of business
and friction which he did not account for at the
time, but which perhaps in a vague manner he may
have ascribed to the purity of the air and the beauty
of the day.</p>

<p>The sun was streaming into his windows from
over the Park. It was already warm, and as he
dressed and shaved himself he allowed his thoughts
to wander with an unaccustomed freedom over the
simple things of life. He noted the colour of the
trees; he was glad to see the happiness of the
passers-by in the streets below; he felt an unaccountable
sympathy with the human race, and he was
even touched with contempt as he gazed at the long
procession of wealthy houses which marked the line
of Park Lane.</p>

<p>At breakfast he ate heartily, though he was alone;
he looked at the small batch of letters which awaited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
him, and when he opened his newspaper he positively
laughed at the opinions expressed in the leading
article. He nearly broke into another laugh as he
read the news from America, and then&mdash;with a gesture
which horrified the two solemn servants who had
watched the unaccountable change in their master&#8217;s
manner, he tore the paper rapidly into four pieces
and threw it on the floor. Having done this he
jumped up gaily, nodded to the menials, said &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t expect that,&#8221; walked briskly out, took his hat
and coat and with no conscious purpose but as
habit moved him jumped into a motor-bus going
East.</p>

<p>The conductor, who had a respect for Sir Charles
Repton&#8217;s clothes, and especially for his spats, and
who seemed to recognise his face, asked him gently
how much he desired to spend upon a ticket: to
which he answered in a breezy manner, &#8220;Penny of
course. Never pay more than a penny; then if the
beastly thing breaks down you&#8217;re not out of pocket ... &#8217;sides
which,&#8221; he went on as though talking to
himself, &#8220;if they forget about you you can have
tuppence-worth or thruppence-worth for the same
money!&#8221; And he chuckled.</p>

<p>The conductor looked at him first in terror, then
smiled responsively and went forward to deal with
less fortunate people, while Sir Charles hummed
gently to himself,&mdash;a little out of tune but none the
less cheerfully on that account&mdash;an air of ribald
associations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>The top of the bus was pretty full, and a workman
who had occasion to travel in the same direction as
his betters saw fit to sit down in the one empty
place beside the Baronet. It would have been difficult
to decide upon what occupation this honest
man had most recently been engaged: but there
had certainly entered into it oil, wet clay, probably
soot, and considerable masses of oxidised copper.
It was not remarkable, therefore, that, beside such
a companion, especially as that companion was a
large man, Sir Charles should have found himself
considerably incommoded. What <i>was</i> remarkable
was the manner in which the Baronet expressed his
annoyance. He turned round upon the workman
with an irritated frown and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make out why they allow people like
you on omnibuses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer carn&#8217;t wort?&#8221; said the breadwinner in a
threatening voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I · can&#8217;t · make · out,&#8221; answered Sir Charles,
carefully picking out each word&mdash;&#8220;I · can&#8217;t · make ·
out · why · they · allow · people · like · you on omnibuses,&mdash;dirty
<i>brutes</i> like you, I should say. Why
the devil....&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the workman seized Sir Charles
by the collar. Sir Charles, though an older man,
was by no means weak; his tall body was well-knit
and active, and he felt unaccountably brawny that
morning; he got the thumb and forefinger of his
left hand like a pitchfork under his opponent&#8217;s chin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and there began what promised to be a very pretty
scuffle. Everybody on the top of the bus got up,
a woman tittered, and a large consequential fellow
who attempted to interfere received a violent backhander
from the huge left hand of the Operative,
the wrist of which was firmly grasped by the right
of the Politician and was struggling in the air.</p>

<p>The bus stopped, a crowd gathered, the workman,
as is customary with hard-working people, was
easily appeased; Sir Charles, a good deal ruffled,
got off the bus, and pressing two shillings into the
hand of a policeman who was preparing to take
notes, said loudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right! You can&#8217;t do anything against
<i>me</i>, and of course I can prevent the thing getting
into the papers; but it&#8217;s always better to give a
policeman money,&mdash;safe rule!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he wormed his way through the increasing
mob and disappeared into a taxi, the driver of
which, with singular sagacity, drove off rapidly
without asking for any direction. When he was
well out of it, Repton put his head out of the window
and addressed the driver in the following remarkable
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know where you&#8217;d better go: of
course if you go to my Club I could change there&#8221;
(his collar was torn off him and his hat was badly
battered) &#8220;but on the whole you&#8217;d better take me
to Guy&#8217;s&mdash;No you hadn&#8217;t, go to the Club. Stop at
a Boy Messenger&#8217;s on your way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>&#8220;What Club, sir?&#8221; asked the driver with the
deference due to a man at once wealthy and mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t know it,&#8221; said Sir Charles kindly and
still craning in a constrained manner out of the
window. &#8220;By the way, why don&#8217;t they have a
speaking-tube or something from inside to you
people? It&#8217;s awkward turning one&#8217;s head outside
like a snake. You won&#8217;t know it, but I&#8217;ll shout to
you when we get to the bottom of St. James&#8217;s Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver, now convinced that he had to do with
something quite out of the ordinary, touched his cap
in a manner almost military, and fled through the
streets of London. At a Boy Messenger&#8217;s office Sir
Charles sent home for clothes and for a change, got
to his Club, informed the astonished porter that it
was a very fine day, that he had just had a fight
on the top of a bus, that by God the Johnnie didn&#8217;t
know who he was tackling! He, Sir Charles, was
no longer a young man, but he would have shown
him what an upper cut was if he could have got
a free swing! He proceeded to illustrate the nature
of this fence&mdash;then suddenly asked for his letters,
and for a dressing-room.</p>

<p>After this, which had all been acted in the most
rapid and violent manner, he ran up the steps, stood
for a few moments with his hands in his pockets
gazing at the telegrams, and forgetful that he had
no collar on, that his coat was torn, that there was
blood upon his hands, and that half of his waistcoat
was wide open with two buttons missing. He found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the telegrams of some interest; he did not notice
the glances directed towards him by those who
passed in and out of the building, nor the act of a
page who in passing the porter&#8217;s box tapped his
forehead twice with his forefinger.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment in thought, then it
suddenly occurred to him that it would have been
a wiser thing to have gone straight home. He got
another taxi and drove to his house. There, after a
brief scene with the footman in which he rehearsed
all that he had already given them at the Club, he
ordered his clothes to be put out for him, and took a
very comfortable bath.</p>

<p>Luckily for him he found lying upon his table
when he came down, a note which he had left there
the night before with regard to the Van Diemens
meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgot that,&#8221; he said, a little seriously. &#8220;Good
thing I found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked it up, folded it once or twice, unfolded
it, re-read it perhaps three times, and while he was
so employed heard the grave voice of his secretary
begging him to go into town in the motor.</p>

<p>Repton did not for the moment see any connection
between his recent adventures and this request, but
he was all compliance, and nodding cheerfully he
waited for the machine to come round. When it
had come he looked at it closely for a moment,
confided to the chauffeur that he intensely disliked
its colour, but that it was a bargain and he wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
going to spend any money on changing it, because
he meant to sell it to some fool at the end of the
season&mdash;got in, and was driven to the Cannon Street
Hotel.</p>

<p>He was a little late. The platform was already
occupied and his empty chair was waiting for him.</p>

<p>At his entry there was some applause, such as
would naturally greet the man who was known to
be the Directing Brain of all that interest. None
noticed a change in him. His clothes were perhaps
a little less spick and span: it was unusual to see
him stretch his arms two or three times before he
sat down, and those who knew him best, in his
immediate neighbourhood upon the platform, were
astonished to see him smile and nod familiarly to
several of the less important Directors; but on the
whole he behaved himself in a fairly consecutive
manner, and if he did whisper to a colleague upon
his right that he looked as though he had been
drinking a little too much overnight, the unaccustomed
jest was allowed to pass without
comment.</p>

<p>When the moment came for him to speak, he
jumped up, perhaps a little too briskly, faced his
audience with less than his usual solemnity, nay,
with something very like a grin, and struck the first
note of his great speech in a manner which they had
hitherto never heard from his lips.</p>

<p>It was certainly calculated to compel their attention
if not their conviction, for the very first words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which he shouted into the body of the hall, were
these:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>After that rhetorical question, delivered in a roar
that would have filled the largest railway station in
London, he repeated it in a somewhat lower tone,
clenched his fists, struck them squarely on the table,
and answered as though he were delivering a final
judgment:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>MONEY!....</i></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he went on, raising his
right hand and wagging his forefinger at them&mdash;&#8220;we
are here for money! And don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He blew a great breath, watched them quizzically
a moment and then continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>most</i> of you <i>most</i> lack is the power of
thinking clearly. I can see it in your faces. I can
see it in the way you sit. And people who can&#8217;t
think clearly don&#8217;t make <i>money</i>. No one can think
clearly who hasn&#8217;t got a good grip of his first
principles and doesn&#8217;t know first of all what he wants
before he tries to get it. Well, I repeat it, and
I challenge any one to deny it: what we want is
<i>money</i>! Let us make that quite clear. Let us
anchor ourselves to that ... and when we once
have that thoroughly fixed in our minds we can
go on to the matter of how we are to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he proceeded in a
more conversational manner, rubbing his hands
together, and smiling at them with excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
freedom, &#8220;let us first of all take stock. Sitting
here before me and round me here upon this
platform (he waved his right arm in a large gesture)
are four million pounds of Van Diemens stock.
Four million pounds, ladies and gentlemen! But
wait a moment. At what price was that stock
bought? I am not asking at what price <i>I</i> bought,&#8221;&mdash;here
he looked to the left and the right, sweeping
the hundreds of faces before him&mdash;&#8220;I am not asking
at what price <i>I</i> bought: my position differs from
yours, my hearties; I&#8217;m in the middle of things and
my official position obtains me even more knowledge
than I should gather with my own very excellent
powers of observation: I&#8217;ve spent a whole lifetime
in watching markets, and I have never cared a <i>dump</i>&mdash;I
repeat, ladies and gentlemen, a DUMP, for
anything except the profit. I have never listened
to any talk about the &#8216;development of a country&#8217; or
&#8216;possibilities&#8217; or &#8216;the future,&#8217; or any kid of that sort.
I&#8217;ve bought paper and sold paper ... and I&#8217;ve done
uncommonly well out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, more for breath than for
anything else, for he had been speaking very rapidly;
and in the terrified silence round him Bingham was
heard muttering as though in reply to some whispered
question: &#8220;You leave him <i>alone</i>! It may be unconventional,
but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is, ladies and gentlemen, at what
price have you bought ... on the average? Many
of you are country parsons, many of you ladies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
far more money than you have knowledge what to
do with it. Not a few of you stock-brokers&mdash;an
exceptionally inexperienced class of men&mdash;you are
a fair average lot of British investors, and I ask
<i>at what price did you buy?</i>&#8221; He looked at them
fixedly for a few moments, then pulling out a scrap
of paper he read it briefly:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;From figures that have been laid before me I
find that the average price at which the present
shareholders bought was eight pounds sixteen
shillings and a few pence,&#8217;&#8221; and then added &#8220;We&#8217;ll
call it eight pounds. Always be on the Conservative
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this remark, which was supposed to contain a
political jest, two old ladies in the second row
tittered, but finding themselves alone, stopped
tittering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say take it at eight pounds. Well, that four
million of stock stands for thirty-two million pounds.
<i>Thirty-two million pounds!</i>&#8221; he said with a rising
voice&mdash;&#8220;THIRTY-TWO MILLION POUNDS!&#8221; he roared,&mdash;banging
the table with his fist and leaning forward
with a determined jowl.... &#8220;And what&#8217;s left of it?
<i>Nothing!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another dead silence at the end of this
striking phrase, and Bingham was again heard to
mutter: &#8220;You leave him <i>alone</i>; he knows what he&#8217;s
at!&#8221; A certain uneasy shuffling of feet behind him
caused Repton to turn his head snappishly, then he
looked round again and resumed his great oration.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;I say <i>nothing</i>.... Oh! I know there are some of
you stupid enough to think that you have still got
sixteen and thruppence a share. That was the
quotation in the paper this morning. Eugh!&#8221; he
sniffed sardonically, &#8220;You try and <i>sell</i> at that and
you&#8217;ll soon find what you&#8217;ve got! No! you haven&#8217;t
even got that sixteen and thruppence. You haven&#8217;t
got two shillings in the pound for what you put in.
You&#8217;ve got nothing! nothing! nothing!! Put that in
your pipes and smoke it....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, gentlemen,&#8221; he added, leaning his body
backwards and putting his thumbs into his waistcoat,
&#8220;the business before us is how to get out of this hole.
There are perhaps some of you,&#8221; he went on, frowning
intellectually, &#8220;there are perhaps some of you who
imagine that the Government is going to buy. Well,
I&#8217;m a member of the Government and I can tell you
they are <i>not</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this appalling remark the elements of revolution
upon the platform all but exploded, but the solid
weight of Bingham was still there, and if I may hint
at a phrase with which the reader is already familiar,
he suggested that Sir Charles knew what he was
about and should be let <i>alone</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if they did buy,&#8221; Repton went on seriously
and argumentatively, &#8220;they could hardly buy at more
than par. I&#8217;m the last man,&#8221; he continued rapidly &#8220;to
jaw about public opinion or things of that sort. The
real reason why they won&#8217;t buy is the Irish. But even
if they did buy they could hardly give more than par.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
And what&#8217;s par?&#8221; he said with great disdain. &#8220;No,
that cock won&#8217;t fight!... Mind you, I&#8217;m not saying
you couldn&#8217;t have got the Government to buy a little
time ago. I think you could. But you can&#8217;t now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single man on either front
bench&mdash;&#8221; this was said meditatively and tapping off
the fingers of one hand with the forefinger of the
other&mdash;&#8220;who&#8217;s personally interested, and I don&#8217;t
<i>think</i> there&#8217;s any direct connection since Cooke died
between the Cabinet and any one who is&mdash;except me.
No, that&#8217;s not the way out. What you&#8217;ve got to do,
ladies and gentlemen, is to throw a sprat to catch a
whale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sprat,&#8221; he meditatively repeated, &#8220;to catch a
whale: a great Whale full o&#8217; blubber! ... an&#8217; how
are you going to do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen&#8221;&mdash;his tone had become very earnest
and he was leaning forward, bent and fixed and
holding them with his fine strong eyes, &#8220;listen, there
are three steps. You&#8217;ve got first of all to show the
public that you <i>believe</i> in the future of the Company;
next you&#8217;ve got to decide upon a dodge to show
that: something that&#8217;ll make every one think that you
the shareholders do really believe in that future.
What&#8217;s the third step? Why up goes the price&mdash;real
price&mdash;money offered&mdash;<i>then you can sell</i>. That&#8217;s my
opinion,&#8221; he concluded, clapping his hands together
and laying them upon the table before him: and he
let it sink in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ll notice,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;in the prospectus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you have received, some talk of a railway.
We&#8217;re asking money from you to build a railway.
Now why are we doing that? Please follow me
carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hundreds of heads bent forward and the
intelligences they contained were prepared to follow
him carefully. He was a great man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have asked you to build a railway,&#8221; he pronounced,
leaving a little space of time between each
word, &#8220;because a railway still catches on. I don&#8217;t
know why, but it <i>does</i>. Mines don&#8217;t. You might
discover ore all over the place and they wouldn&#8217;t go:
I&#8217;ve got two men of my own, engineers, <i>experts</i>,
who&#8217;ll discover ore anywhere; they&#8217;d discover tons
before three o&#8217;clock this afternoon and you might
swear your dying oath to them, but the public
wouldn&#8217;t believe you. As for agriculture,&mdash;Piff!
And as for climate, Boo! But <i>railways</i> still work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You raise your capital for your
railway. What that railway may be imagined to do
is set out in full before you and I won&#8217;t go into it.
But I will ask you especially to note the passage in
which it is described as giving a strategical supremacy
to the Empire. You know what the Empire is. You
<i>may</i> know, some o&#8217; you, what strategy is. Looks as
if there were a fleecy general or two among you!
But that&#8217;s as may be&mdash;just note the phrase. It&#8217;s
safety! That&#8217;s what it is! No odds. No blighter
to run any risk of having to fight any one anywhere!
Grand!&#8221;... &#8220;I <i>think</i> also,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
could be done with the tourist side ... there are
falls and mountains and things ... but no matter:
the point is the railway.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drank from a glass of water on the table,
turned round angrily and said: &#8220;Good lord what
water! It&#8217;s bad enough to have to drink water in
public for a show, but it needn&#8217;t be tepid! If the
place wasn&#8217;t so public I&#8217;d spit it out again!&#8221; Then
facing the audience again: &#8220;However.... About
that railway. First understand clearly, ladies and
gentlemen, <i>that railway is not going to be built</i>!
There is no intention of building it. There is no
intention of surveying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two or three voices rose in protest at the back of
the hall. Sir Charles leaned forward and put out his
hand appealingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, one moment pray! Hear me out!
I don&#8217;t mean that <i>no</i> one will build it. That&#8217;s not
our funeral. I mean that <i>we</i> won&#8217;t. The &#8216;Company&#8217;
may, whatever that means. But you and I&mdash;the
people who have got into this hole&mdash;<i>we</i> won&#8217;t. It
won&#8217;t be <i>our</i> money. Seize that! Get a hold of that!
It&#8217;s the key to the whole business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little gasps and one profound sigh, but no
interruptions followed this explanation, and Sir
Charles with perfect coolness continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;What we want is five shillings a share&mdash;only five
shillings a share. Five shillings where most of you have
already given a hundred and sixty! Five shillings a
share ... four million shares ... that&#8217;s a million.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
And mind you, only a nominal million. We don&#8217;t
want your two half-crowns; bless you no. All we
want in cash is a shilling. For the rest, you&#8217;ll see in
a moment. Well, there you are then, a shilling, a
miserable shilling. Now just see what that shilling
will do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place it&#8217;ll give publicity and plenty
of it. Breath of public life, publicity! Breath o&#8217;
finance too! We&#8217;ll have that railway marked in a
dotted line on the maps: all the maps: school maps:
office maps. We&#8217;ll have leaders on it and speeches
on it. And good hearty attacks on it. And
th-e-n....&#8221; He lowered his voice to a very
confidential wheedle,&mdash;&#8220;the price&#8217;ll begin to creep
up&mdash;Oh ... o ... oh! the <i>real</i> price, my beloved
fellow-shareholders, the price at which one can
really <i>sell</i>, the price at which one can handle the
<i>stuff</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a great breath of satisfaction. &#8220;Now
d&#8217;ye see? It&#8217;ll go to forty shillings right off, it
ought to go to forty-five, it may go to sixty!...
And then,&#8221; he said briskly, suddenly changing his
tone, &#8220;then, my hearties, you blasted well sell out:
you unload ... you dump &#8217;em. Plenty more fools
where your lot came from. I won&#8217;t advise,&mdash;sell out
just when you see fit. Every man for himself, and
every woman too,&#8221; he said, bowing politely to the
two old ladies in the second row,&mdash;&#8220;and the devil
take the hindmost. But you&#8217;ll all have something,
you&#8217;ll none of you lose it all as it looked like last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
week. Most of you&#8217;ll lose on your first price: late
comers least: a few o&#8217; ye&#8217;ll make if you bought
under two pounds. Anyhow <i>I</i> shall.... There! if
that isn&#8217;t finance I don&#8217;t know what is!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a large happy, final, satisfactory and
conclusive smile, the Builder of Empire, to the
astonishment of every one, looked at his watch,
called upon his Creator as a witness to the lateness
of the hour, and suddenly went out.</p>

<p>It would be delicious to describe what happened
in the vast body of that hall when the Chief had
left it: how the shareholders made a noise like
angry bees swarming; how a curate who had done
no man any harm was squashed against a wall and
broke two ribs; how five or six excited and almost
tearful men surrounded the reporters and fought
for their notebooks; how Bingham continued to
reiterate that Charles Repton knew what he was at;
and how a certain quiet little man with a bronzed
face and very humorous eyes, slunk out and got
rid of his block of shares within the hour, to a
young hearty Colonial gentleman who was wealthy
and had come to London to learn the business ways
of our City.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But I must follow Sir Charles in his rapid drive
to the House of Commons. I must mention his
unconventional remark to the policeman to the effect
that he hoped that old fool Pottle hadn&#8217;t come in
yet; and his taking his place on the front bench just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
after prayers with a look so merry and free that it
illumined the faces opposite like a sun.</p>

<p>The questions to which he had to reply came
somewhat late on the paper, and he caused not a
little scandal by suggesting in a low tone such
answers to his colleagues for <i>their</i> questions as
seemed to him at once humorous and apposite.</p>

<p>The aged Home Secretary especially afforded
him fine sport, and when a question was asked with
regard to the new Admiralty docks at Bosham, he
went to the length of chucking a cocked-hat note
to the principal contractor who sat solemnly upon
the benches behind him, nodding cheerfully over
his shoulder and whispering loudly: &#8220;It&#8217;s all up!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this boded ill for what might happen when
his own turn came; and indeed the scene that
followed was of a kind entirely novel in the long
history of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>It was a simple question; Question 63. Not ten
minutes of question-time were left when it was
asked. It was put by a gentle little man who
had put it down for the sake of a friend who lived
on the South Coast, and it was simply to ask the
right honourable Baronet, the Warden of the Court
of Dowry, whether his attention had been called
to the presence upon the Royal Sovereign shoals of
a wreck which endangered navigation, and what
he intended to do in the matter.</p>

<p>Charles Repton jumped up like a bird; he
jovially and rapidly read the typewritten answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which his permanent officials had given him&mdash;to
the effect that he had nothing to add to the reply
given three years before with regard to the same
wreck, which was then, they were careful to point
out, far more dangerous than at the present day.</p>

<p>But when he had finished reading the official
reply, he looked up genially at his interlocutor and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to interfere with that wreck: it&#8217;s
full of gin!&#8221;</p>

<p>An angry fanatic hearing the word &#8220;gin&#8221; rose at
once and put the supplementary question: &#8220;May I
ask whether that gin was destined for the unfortunate
natives of the Lagos Hinterland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Warden of the Court of Dowry
politely, &#8220;Yes sir, you may: but they will never get
it. However, several thousand tons of gin I am
glad to say have gone out to the negroes of our
colonies since the ship was lost, to the no small
advantage,&#8221; he added, &#8220;of my friend Mr. Garey;
whom, by the way,&#8221; he continued with conversational
ease, &#8220;we all hope to see in this House shortly, for
old Southwick who&#8217;s up against him hasn&#8217;t got a
dog&#8217;s chance, and you probably know that we are
forcing Pipps to resign. Bound to be an election!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down. It was a quarter to four and the
House was saved. But though the decorum of that
great assembly prevented one word from being
uttered as to what had passed, the Lobbies were full
of it, and when the first division was taken men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ordinarily filed past the Treasury bench avoided it,
while from distant and dark corners where one
cannot be observed, long and intent looks were
darted at the happy Warden of the Court of Dowry.</p>

<p>He sat there gay and quite unconscious of the
effect he had produced, passed with his Party into
the Lobbies for the division, greeting with familiar
joy men who appeared rather anxious to avoid his
eye, and making, I regret to say, such unseemly
jests upon the Party system as had never been heard
within those walls before.</p>

<p>The young Prime Minister, though suffering so
considerably from the left lung, was never at a loss
where tact, and especially tact combined with rapid
action, was necessary. A horrified servant called
him from his room and described what was passing.
He did not stop to ask why or how the thing had
happened. He came in rapidly through the door
behind the Speaker&#8217;s chair, and beckoned to Sir
Charles Repton who was at that moment occupied
in drawing a large caricature of the Leader of the
Opposition, with his hands deep into the pocket of
an amiable farmer-like gentleman in top-boots and
whiskers, who made a presentable image of John
Bull.</p>

<p>Charles Repton got up at once and went out to
his Chief. &#8220;What d&#8217;you think of this?&#8221; he said,
showing his picture.</p>

<p>The young Prime Minister smiled as death would
smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s very good, it&#8217;s very good,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hurriedly. &#8220;Have it coloured ... colour it yourself.
Oh, do what you like with it.... Come with me.
Come into my room, do. No, I&#8217;ll tell you what,
I want to speak to you. Let&#8217;s get out into the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked his subordinate away rapidly arm in
arm across Parliament Square towards St. James&#8217;s
Park, talking about a thousand things and never
giving Repton time for a word. Then he said
suddenly: &#8220;What I really want to say to you,
Repton, is ...&#8221; He abruptly broke off. &#8220;Is Lady
Repton at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Repton a little puzzled, &#8220;or she will
be by this time. I make her show me her plan for
the afternoon at lunch, and she&#8217;s got to suit me, or
there&#8217;s a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, &#8220;will you do
me a great favour?&#8221; He put his hand on Repton&#8217;s
shoulder and looked candidly into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly my dear fellow,&#8221; answered the Warden
of the Court of Dowry in the utmost good humour.
&#8220;After all my position depends upon you, and a
good deal of my income depends upon my position.
It isn&#8217;t likely I should put your back up, even if I
didn&#8217;t like you, which is far from being the case,
though I must say I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re a man of
very exceptional talent. I think you owe most of
your position to birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the Prime Minister hurriedly,
&#8220;I understand. Now what I want you to do is this:
jump into the first thing you see and <i>go straight home</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
You will see why when you get there. It&#8217;s absolutely
urgent. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Repton more puzzled than ever.
&#8220;All you politicians are such liars that I make a
point of believing the exact opposite of what you
say: but if you tell me it&#8217;s of any service to you, it
certainly does <i>me</i> no harm.&#8221; And whistling gaily
he walked off towards a cab that was meandering
across the Parade.</p>

<p>When the Prime Minster had seen him well off
he went as rapidly as dignity would allow into
Downing Street, took the telephone from his
secretary and in an agony of apprehension lest he
should be too late, at last heard Lady Repton&#8217;s
voice. He told her that her husband was the
victim of a most distressing malady; she would
understand it when she saw him. He implored her
to save so valuable a man for the country by
managing in some way or other to confine him to
the house until he should be medically examined.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to the young fellow to have
got this duty done. His fifty-four years seemed to
weigh less upon him: for the ten minutes between
leaving the House and seeing Repton off he had been
on a grill: there was still ridicule to be faced, but
he had a sentiment of having achieved his end and
of having just saved as difficult a situation as ever
the chief of a State had had to meet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was an anxious moment, but many moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
are necessarily anxious in the life of a man who
holds in his hands the destinies of Great Britain, and
the young and popular Prime Minister had the stuff
in him to stand worse scenes than that, but he was
exhausted and he was slightly troubled. The full
consequences of the dreadful affair had not yet shaped
themselves in his mind.</p>

<p>He walked back to his room in the House of
Commons, ruminating during those few steps upon
the developments that might arise from Repton&#8217;s
terrible accident, and beginning to plan how he
should arrange matters with Demaine. It would
want caution, for Demaine was slow to understand
... but then there was a corresponding advantage
to that, for like all slow men, Dimmy could hold his
tongue.... In fact he couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was pleased to think that he
had that second string to his bow, and that opinion
had been sufficiently prepared for the change.
Repton would be certified of course, the sooner the
better,&mdash;that would prevent any necessity for a
peerage. Demaine&#8217;s taking the place would seem
more natural, and those gadflies, the <i>Moon</i> and the
<i>Capon</i>, would not fall into a fever about the appointment....
Perhaps after all the Repton business
would be an advantage in the long run!</p>

<p>The more he thought of his choice of Demaine
the more pleased he was, and he had almost persuaded
himself that the appointment was due to
some extreme cunning upon his own part, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
coming round from his room into the Lobbies, he
casually asked a colleague where Demaine was at
the moment.</p>

<p>The colleague didn&#8217;t know. &#8220;I have my back
turned to the benches behind us you know,&#8221; he
explained elaborately.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister cast upon him a look of
contempt, and asked the doorkeeper whether he had
seen Mr. Demaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;G. M. Demaine,&#8221; said the doorkeeper solemnly,
running his finger down a list.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was almost moved to reprove
him, but dignity forbade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the House!&#8221; said the man curtly,
addressing as an equal the chief power in England; for
his post was secure, the Prime Minister&#8217;s precarious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean not on the benches: I can see that
for myself!&#8221; said the Prime Minister sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean he hasn&#8217;t passed this door, sir,&#8221; said the
official with quiet dignity, and Dolly went off
considerably nettled, and looked into the tea-room
and the libraries, and even wasted a little time in
going round by the smoking-room. The policemen
in the central hall had not seen Demaine, nay, a
constituent with an exceedingly long black moustache
and fierce eyes had been waiting by appointment
with Demaine for two hours, and Demaine had not
been found. The Prime Minister condescended so
much as to speak to this man, and the man, not
knowing whom he might be addressing, told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
plainly that &#8220;if Mr. Demaine interpreted his duties
in this fashion, he couldn&#8217;t answer for his seat, that
was all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister further condescended to go
out of the House in the ordinary way, and the
policeman who guarded the ordinary portal had not
seen Mr. Demaine.</p>

<p>It was really very awkward and exasperating,
though it was only a detail. He must see Demaine
that afternoon: it was imperative. But it was also
important that he should see him as soon as possible.
He wanted to keep him out of the way till he was
coached.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this happy English life of
ours more soothing to the brain in moments of
anxiety, than the perusal of any one of those great
Organs of Opinion which are the characteristic of
our people and the envy of Europe, and of these
it must be admitted none stand on quite the same
intellectual and moral plane as the best two or
three of our London evening papers. One of these
the Prime Minister had always found particularly
soothing. He bought it of the newsman at the
corner of Parliament Square and opened it as he
walked along at leisure towards Downing Street.</p>

<p>There was one corner of this sheet which was
always a recreation to Dolly in the few moments
he could spare from the House: it was the corner
in which prizes were offered for the best pun, on
condition of course that nothing coarse or personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
offensive should be sent in by the competitors. To
this he had turned an indifferent eye, when for the
second time that day he received a shock which was
almost like a blow in the face....</p>

<p>There, in great letters, with a flamboyance surely
unworthy of a paper that professed to support his
own Party, was the headline:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;DISAPPEARANCE OF A MINISTER ELECT.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his forebodings did not deceive him....
It was ... it was ... the permanently unlucky
Demaine!</p>

<p>He cursed the crass imbecility by which such a
thing could have got into the papers at all. He
strode to his house and to his room, crumpled the
paper which he was still holding, unfolded it, and
then read the news again. There were but a few
lines of it: Demaine had disappeared, and the full
detective power of London was attempting to solve
the mystery of his disappearance.</p>

<p>What madness to let such things get out!</p>

<p>Why, twenty things might have happened! He
might simply have stopped in the house of a friend
and not bothered to tell his wife that he was not
coming home; he might simply have fallen ill
and have been taken to a hospital or to a hotel.
What a piece of idiocy to put it into the Press at
all!</p>

<p>Much as he hated the exercise, he rang to be put
through to Demaine House, and heard from Sudie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
herself, whom he knew but distantly, that her fears
had done all.</p>

<p>She had sat up for George till nearly five o&#8217;clock
in the morning; underrating perhaps her husband&#8217;s
talents, and notably his ability to find his way home,
she thought it possible he had fallen a victim to
an unscrupulous taxi driver or that any one of a
thousand other fates might have befallen him.</p>

<p>With too little comprehension of the social forces
that build up the society of the Mother Land, Sudie
had communicated at once with Scotland Yard,
and on learning that her husband had last been
seen leaving the House of Commons and walking
towards the river, she had taken the unpardonable
step of sending messages to all the evening papers
in the hope that such publicity would advance the
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>It was perfectly damnable! As though the cares
of his office were not enough, the Prime Minister
found himself upon this Tuesday afternoon with a
doubtful and anxious division awaiting him in the
evening, with one of his Ministers gone mad, and
his successor the subject at the best of a vulgar
mystery, and at the worst of a hopeless disappearance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE phrase &#8220;intoxicated with pleasure,&#8221; too
common in our literature, would most inexactly
describe the condition of George Mulross
Demaine as he left the Prime Minister&#8217;s room upon
that Monday midnight.</p>

<p>In the first place he was not and never had been
intoxicated, and even when he exceeded (as in youth
he frequently had) in the matter of wine, spirits,
liqueurs and fancy liquids, the effect of such excess
had rather been atrophy than intoxication. Nor
had he ever felt what poets finely call the &#8220;sting
of joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was pleased: he was very pleased.
Thoughts that in another more volatile and less
substantial brain might have crowded, appeared
slowly separated one from another and in a solemn
procession. They comforted rather than exhilarated
him.</p>

<p>First of all there was the £5000 a year: that was
something.</p>

<p>He ruminated on that about as far as Cleopatra&#8217;s
Needle; there, as he leant upon the parapet of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Embankment and looked down into the water,
a second thought rose upon the horizon of his
mind: the £5000 a year would be his, not
Sudie&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In the first stage of this nightly ramble he had
barged into two men: one a poor man who had
made the accident the excuse for the delivery of
money; the second a rich one who cursed him
abominably, but George was in too equable a mood
to mind. Now, as he left Cleopatra&#8217;s Needle behind
him and strolled still farther eastward, ruminating
upon the fact that the £5000 a year would be his
and not Sudie&#8217;s, he had the misfortune to cannon
against yet a third, to whom he apologised: but it
was a post, not a man.</p>

<p>He looked at it with those slow, sensible eyes of
his for perhaps thirty seconds, and saw in large red
letters under the electric light &#8220;Motors to the right
of this post.&#8221;</p>

<p>He repeated the phrase mechanically as was often
his wont upon reading anything, and it set up a new
train of thought. Post.... The post offered him
was not permanent ... but he considered the
careers of his friends and he could remember none,
neither Ted nor Johnny nor old Bill Curliss, nor
Fittleworth nor Glegg, who from the moment they
had received such promotion had not gone forward.</p>

<p>It always meant something, even when one was
out of office, and then who knows? One might be
in office again. A Party may be in office twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
running! Stranger things had happened. And
then, even if they went out of office, Ole Man
Benson would have brought something off by that
time.</p>

<p>Look at it how he would, heaven was smiling on
him, and he in return, and as though in gratitude,
smiled at the gaunt front of Blackfriars Station,
opposite which he had now arrived.</p>

<p>Between him and it there lay the street, and he
was naturally too cautious to attempt to cross until
he had gazed carefully to the front and right. But
at midnight there is no pressure of traffic in the City
of London, and when he had allowed a belated dray
and a steam roller to pass him at their leisure he
hurriedly crossed over with a vague intention of
taking the train.</p>

<p>Like many men of the governing classes, whose
mental activities are naturally divorced from the
petty details of London life, and who are independent
of that daily round which makes the less fortunate
only too familiar with our means of communication,
George Mulross Demaine was not quite certain where
the Underground went to, nor what part of London
precisely it served. But he had been taught from
childhood that it was circular in form, and that round
it like Old Ocean<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in a perpetual race, went along
streams of trains. Enter it where you would, and
you might leave it somewhere upon its periphery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>He knew that St. James&#8217;s Park Station was at his
very door. He asked for and obtained a ticket with
that promptitude which distinguishes the service of
our premier Metropolitan line, left the change for
sixpence by an oversight on the ledge of the ticket
window, and then, as Fate would have it, turned to
the left-hand stairs.</p>

<p>The official whose duty it was to examine and to
cut designs upon the tickets presented to him by the
public, was that evening (under the guidance of Fate)
most negligent.</p>

<p>He should surely have seen that he was dealing
with an Obvious Gentleman and should gently have
directed him to the opposing platform. As it was
he did no more than half puncture the cardboard
without so much as glancing at it, and George
Mulross Demaine (in whom now yet another pleasing
thought had arisen&mdash;that there were such things
as Cabinet pensions&mdash;) sauntered down on to the
platform.</p>

<p>A train roared in; he stumbled into it just in time
to save his coat from the shutting of the gate, and
sat contentedly until he should hear the conductor
shout &#8220;St. James&#8217;s Park!&#8221; But this cue word which
would have aroused him to action, he was destined
not to hear.</p>

<p>The Mansion House went by, and Cannon Street,
but yet another pleasing thought having arisen in
his mind he noted them not.</p>

<p>A shout of &#8220;Monument&#8221; startled him, for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
heard in a general way of the Monument, and it was
nowhere near his home. When he came to Mark
Lane he was seriously alarmed, and at the cry of
Aldgate East, his mind was made up. He got out.</p>

<p>He asked with the utmost courtesy of the man
who took the tickets what he should do to get to
St. James&#8217;s Park, and the man who took the tickets
replied with less courtesy but with great rapidity
that he had better turn sharp to the right and that
on his right again he would find Aldgate Station,
whence there was still a service of trains, late as was
the hour.</p>

<p>Alas, for the various locutions of various ranks in
our society! he did turn sharp to the right; he went
right round the corner into Middlesex Street, and to
the right again into Wentworth Street, but not a
station could be seen. The summer night was of
a glimmering sort of darkness. It was hot, and
many of the local families were still seated upon
their steps, speaking to each other in a dialect of
the Lithuanian Ghetto which George Mulross
erroneously took for an accent native to the London
poor.</p>

<p>He stepped up to one and asked whether he were
yet near the station. The voluble reply &#8220;Shriska
beth haumelshee! Chragso! Yeh!&#8221; illumined him
not at all, and as he moved off uncertainly up the
street, a roar of harsh laughter tended to upset his
nerves.</p>

<p>He could not bear this raking fire: he turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
most imprudently, up a narrow court which was in
total darkness; and, then at first to his surprise but
almost immediately afterwards to his grave chagrin,
he felt a voluminous and exceedingly foul cotton
sheet drawn sharply round his throat, twisted, the
slack of it thrown over his head, and one end
crammed into his mouth for a gag; almost at the
same moment his wrists were jerked behind him, a
rope whose hardness must have been due to tar was
hitched round them with surely excessive violence,
putting him to grievous pain, his feet were lifted
from under him, he felt several hands grasping his
head and shoulders at random, a couple of them
seizing his ankles; he was reversed, and in the attitude
described at the Home Office as &#8220;The Frogs&#8217;
March&#8221; he felt himself carried for some few yards,
and at last reversed again and placed face upwards
upon a narrow and hard surface.</p>

<p>Through the filthy cotton which still enveloped
his face, the disgusting stains of which were dimly
apparent to him, he saw the glimmer of a light, and
he heard round him language the accent and many
of the words of which were so unfamiliar to him that
he could make nothing of it. He was incommoded
beyond words.</p>

<p>Whatever his defects, George Mulross Demaine
was not lacking in physical courage; he begged
them in a mumble through the gag that covered his
mouth, to let him go. There was no direct reply,
but only a good deal of whispering, which so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
he could make it out&mdash;and much of it was foreign&mdash;related
to his person rather than to his request.</p>

<p>An attempt to move betrayed the fact that some
heavy body was seated upon his shins; another
attempt to raise the upper half of his body was met
by so sharp a reminder upon the side of his head
that he thought it better for the moment to lie still.</p>

<p>What followed was an examination of his clothes
and their contents, which showed his new neighbours
to be unacquainted with the sartorial habits of the
wealthy. The two slits in his cape were taken for
pockets and their emptiness provoked among other
comments the shrill curse of a woman. His trouser
pockets, wherein it was fondly hoped that metal
might lie hid, and wherein he would rather have died
than have put anything, similarly drew blank, and
to their disgust, of the two little lines on the waistcoat
one was a sham and the other contained nothing
but a spare stud. However, this contained a small
precious stone, and was the immediate object of a
pretty severe scuffle.</p>

<p>He was next reversed yet a third time without
dignity, and in a manner the violence of which was
most wounding: but in his tail pocket was nothing but
a large new silk handkerchief which went (apparently
by custom, for there was no discussion) to the captain
of the tribe.</p>

<p>Purse there was none, a thing that bewildered
them; not even a portmonnaie, until, to their mingled
astonishment and joy, some one acuter than the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
discovered in a mass of seals at his watch chain, a
little globular receptacle which opened with a spring,
and revealed no less than four sovereigns.</p>

<p>It was a poor haul, but the clothes remained. Not
for long. They were all removed, and that not with
roughness but, he was glad to note, tenderly: less
perhaps from the respect they bore him than from a
consideration of the value of the cloth. The precise
man&oelig;uvre whereby the difficulty of the ankles and
the wrists was eliminated, I leave to those of my
readers who are better acquainted with such problems
than I. There are several well-known methods, I
understand, whereby a man may have his trousers
and his coat removed and yet his hands and feet
preserved in custody.</p>

<p>His boots (they were astonished to note) were
elastic-sided. They were under the impression that
among the wealthy buttoned boots alone were
tolerated at the evening meal and thenceforward
until such hours as the wealthy seek repose. But
they were good mess boots, and take it all in all,
his clothing, every single article of which was soon
folded and put into its bundle, made the best part of
their booty.</p>

<p>Then there was a considerable movement of feet,
a murmur of voices purposely low; there seemed to
be one person left, agile and rapid in movement ...
perhaps two: at any rate after these or this one had
held him for some thirty seconds, during which he
had the sense and prudence to lie still, there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
sharp sliding of feet, the quick but almost noiseless
shutting of a door, and he found that he was free.</p>

<p>His first act was to disembarrass himself of his
stinking head-gear, but his captors had laid their
trap with science, and it was precisely this which was
destined to give them the leisure for their escape.
The sheet was tied to his head by a series of small
hard knots which took him, between them, quite a
quarter of an hour to undo.</p>

<p>At last he was free. He tore the filthy thing from
his head and the bunch of it from his mouth with the
same gesture, overcame a strong desire to vomit, and
looked round him.</p>

<p>He found himself seated upon a sort of narrow
bench attached by iron clamps to the wall of a small
and exceedingly noisome room, which even at that
moment he had the wit to think that he would
certainly have dealt with by the local inspector when
he should have assumed what he had heard called
the reins of office.</p>

<p>But for the moment other considerations occupied
him to the exclusion of the condition of the room.
A dirty paraffin lamp with no shade stood on the
rickety table; the one window was blinded by a
large old wooden shutter barred down against it; on
the cracked, distempered walls, stained with a generation
of grease and smoke, hung a paper upon which
a few figures had been scrawled roughly in pencil,
and most of them scratched out again, and here and
there the same pencil or others had inscribed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
surface of the plaster with sentiments and illustrations
most uncongenial to his breeding.</p>

<p>The next thing that met his eye was a peculiarly
repulsive pair of breeches, an old green-black torn
overcoat, and a pair of workmen&#8217;s boots, cracked,
grey with weather, laceless and apparently as stiff as
wood. He had no choice: his first business was to
find aid. He must put these on, break his way out
of this den as best he could, and summon the Police.</p>

<p>He had never had his feet in such things as those
boots before; it was like shuffling in boxes. He
hated to feel the clammy grease of the trousers and
coat against his skin.</p>

<p>He left the lamp burning and made for the door.
To his astonishment the latch was open. To his
further astonishment it gave into an open passage
like a tunnel, with no door but a plain arch opening
into the court beyond. He shuffled out. He was glad
that it was not yet day. Fortunately it was not cold.</p>

<p>He turned, he knew not whither, following the
streets aimlessly, but more or less in one direction,
until he saw in a blotted silhouette against the darkness
of the walls, the glad and familiar form of a
policeman. It was like coming home! It was like
making a known harbour light after three days of
lost reckonings and a gale.</p>

<p>He went up to the man and began in that
pleasant but not condescending tone in which he
had ever addressed members of the force:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;Policeman, can you tell me....&#8221;</p>

<p>He got no further. The agile though weighty
custodian of order, with the low and determined
remark, &#8220;I know yer!&#8221; had seized him by the
shoulders, whirled him round and away, so that he
fell, bruised and a little dazed, against the steps of
a house.</p>

<p>George was angered. He had already risen with
some remark on his lips about taking a number
when he saw his antagonist make a sharp gesture&mdash;there
was a shrill whistle, immediately afterwards
an answering whistle from perhaps a hundred yards
away, and George Mulross Demaine,&mdash;blame him if
you will,&mdash;kicked off the impossible boots, and ran
for it.</p>

<p>They let him run, and it is not for us to criticise.
He left their district at any rate.</p>

<p>He had run for but a few moments in his absurd
and horrible greatcoat and on his naked feet, until
he saw down the end of an alley a great gate, a light
to one side of it, and beyond it an empty space of
glimmering nightly sky. Ignorant of where he was
or what he did, but determined upon safety, he
looked round and to his horror saw the form of yet
another policeman pacing slowly towards the place
where he was crouching.</p>

<p>That determined him. With an agility that none
of his acquaintances, not even his wife, would have
believed to be in him, he slunk quite close to earth
in the shadow of the great gate and entered the open
space beyond.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Such a space he had never seen. Under the very
faint light which was now beginning to show over
the east of heaven, he guessed that he was upon the
river, for he saw masts against the sky and that
peculiar pale glint of water which, even at night,
may be distinguished between the hulls of ships. All
he sought was shadow, and the great wharves of the
docks&mdash;for he had blundered into the docks&mdash;give
ample opportunity.</p>

<p>He heard a measured step pacing slowly towards
him. He crept along the edge of the quay into a
sort of narrow lane that lay between a row of high
barrels and the bulwarks of a big steamship which
just showed above the stone. He flattened himself
against the high barrels which, had he been better
acquainted with the details of commerce, he would
have known to contain fishbone manure.</p>

<p>The measured tread came nearer; it passed, it
reached a certain point in the distance, it turned and
passed again. It reached yet another extreme of its
beat, turned and re-passed.... And all the while
the light was growing: and as it grew the nervous
agony of George Mulross grew with it, but more
rapidly.</p>

<p>He could now just see the figure of the watchman
near the gate, he could distinguish part of the nearer
rigging; in half an hour he would be visible to whatever
eyes were watching for vagabonds. He knew
what that meant; further humiliation, perhaps further
dangers. There was not a gentleman for miles,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with that thought the heart of this most unfortunate
of gentlemen beat slow.</p>

<p>The reader has been sufficiently told that Mr.
Demaine, however solid the quality of his brain, was
not a man of rapid decision. But agony and peril
are sharp spurs, and as the conception of a gentleman
floated through his mind he suddenly remembered
that ships had captains.</p>

<p>Upon their exact functions he was hazy; he would
know it better no doubt when he had undertaken
his functions in the Court of Dowry (the blessed
thought warmed him for a moment even in that
dreadful dawn!); anyhow, the word &#8220;captain&#8221; meant
something ... it wasn&#8217;t like a captain in the army of
course ... but then there were captains and captains
... of course the Royal Navy was superior to the
Merchant Service ... but it was all the same kind
of thing&mdash;only upper and lower, like a barrister and
a solicitor.... For instance there was the Naval
Reserve.... And he remembered a captain upon an
Atlantic liner who was a splendid great fellow, and
he was sure could tell any one at once. And the
captain of Billy&#8217;s schooner was better than that
because he understood about motor engines.</p>

<p>He had just come to the point of remembering
that on the P. and O. it was rather a grand thing to
dine with the captain, when his mind arrived at its
conclusion. He would slip over the side of the big
ship, and when the proper time came he would reveal
himself to the captain for what he was. The captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
would show him every courtesy, he would give him
a change of clothes, ready-made but decent, he
would know where there was a telephone, he would
have authority to speak to the watchman and the
rest, he would send for a taxi, and George&#8217;s troubles
would be over....</p>

<p>George prepared to slip over the side.</p>

<p>Now to slip over the side in a book is one thing,
but to do it on a real ship is another. The bulwarks
were high and greasy and salt and slimy. Demaine
was weakened by a night of terrors, and he came
down on the hard iron deck of the tramp with a
noise resembling distant thunder, and in a manner
that hurt him very much indeed.</p>

<p>It was a new misadventure and one that had to
be repaired. He heard voices and bolted for a large
coil of rope which lay beneath the shadow of the
turtle-deck. Here the stench, though somewhat
different in quality from that of the fishbone manure,
was not less noisome, and carried with it a reminiscence
of Channel passages which weakened the
very soul within George Mulross Demaine. But the
sensation was soon swamped in one much more
poignant; this was aroused in him by the approach
of two inharmonious voices, one of which was borne
towards him perpetually clamouring:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ah deed!&#8221;</p>

<p>While the other repeated as a sort of antiphon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noa ee diddun, tha silly fule!&#8221;</p>

<p>When this dialogue was exhausted the first voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in a lower and much more determined tone
hissed: &#8220;Ah&#8217;ll ave im aowt!&#8221; and a large stave which
might, for all Demaine knew, be a marlingspike or
some other horrid instrument, began rummaging
behind the coil of rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217;ould man sez ef ah doan catch next &#8217;un ee&#8217;ll
skin me live!&#8221;</p>

<p>To this the second voice reiterated his certitude
that his companion was a silly fool, and that he had
had stowaways upon the brain since he was last
made responsible for the presence of one of these
supercargoes upon the <i>Lily</i>.</p>

<p>The voices moved away and Demaine, while he
breathed somewhat more freely, was back again in
his former doubt and terror.</p>

<p>It grew to be broad day; he heard the rattling of
chains; the presence of men upon every hand made
him but the more determined to remain in his hiding-place
until he could approach the Captain in some
more convenient manner than through the medium
of the unfeeling and ill-educated North Countrymen
who seemed to compose the crew.</p>

<p>He felt the great ship swinging, he could see the
patch of cloud in the sky of which he had a glimpse,
turning as she turned, he felt the slight throb of her
engines; she was passing down the dock, she was out
of the gate&mdash;she was almost in the river, when, to his
horror ... the coil of rope which had been his
bulwark against an unfeeling world, <i>began slowly to
uncoil at the top</i>, with the motion of some great and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wicked snake that was making for its harmless
prey.</p>

<p>Had George Mulross attained that acquaintance
with seafaring terms which is proper to an
administrator of this sea-girt isle (and especially to
a Warden of the Court of Dowry), he would have
known that the rapidly disappearing coil before him
was being used as a warping rope, and he would
have connected the steady clank of the donkey
engine which accompanied its disappearance with
the absorption of fathom after fathom of what had
been kindly shelter. But even had he known these
things it is doubtful whether they would have
interested him at the moment.</p>

<p>He crouched lower and lower as the coil diminished,
occupying the smallest space compatible with
keeping his legs tucked away behind what was left
of the cable: but the Gods were deaf that morning
to all prayers. The last eighteen inches of the coil&#8217;s
height were reached and still the pitiless donkey
engine clanked, and still the lengths went slithering
away, until at last his back appeared above the
element it lived in,&mdash;the unmistakable back of a
human being, clothed in a ragged green-black
coat.</p>

<p>To the trained and piercing eye of sailor-men the
object was unmistakable, and like two cats upon one
mouse his acquaintances of an hour before pounced
upon his trembling form: the sceptical one now converted
and protesting that he had been convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
from the first of the stowaway&#8217;s presence, the other
in cruel triumph dragging him along the deck and
threatening him with such consequences as not even
the peculiar idiom of the North Country could completely
veil.</p>

<p>With such energy as remained to him, George
sprang up at the first opportunity they gave him.
He had the sense not to run upon those crowded
and confined decks. The button torn off his coat-collar
in the scramble showed his bare neck and
chest. Masses of grime, tar and dust streaked his
face; his hair was most untidy, and his bootless feet
were caked in mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see the captain,&#8221; he said between his
gasps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha wants...!&#8221; began his irate captor,&mdash;then
plain words failed him, and he took refuge in a few
oaths. The other said more quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;lt see im, ladd; ow! tha&#8217;lt see im,&#8221;&mdash;and
he nodded twice gravely in a manner which George
would have found reassuring had he not already
begun to suspect that the lower classes were capable
of sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;lt see im!&#8221; he suddenly repeated with the
utmost ferocity; and catching Demaine sharply by
the back of the neck he ran him in to the semi-darkness
under the bridge where, as luck would have
it, the first officer in a somewhat surly mood was
going down off duty.</p>

<p>I should over-weight these pages were I so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
as to attempt the language of the first officer when
he cast eyes upon the unfortunate figure before him.
A stowaway! It was the second time it had
happened in three months.</p>

<p>One stammering attempt to make himself heard so
dreadfully increased the power of this man&#8217;s passion
that George perforce was silent. The first officer&#8217;s rage
rose into a sort of typhoon, and had the law or even the
custom of the sea permitted him to do one quarter of
that with which he threatened the poor vagabond, a
British ship would certainly be no fit place to live in.
As a matter of fact when his tirade was over he confined
himself to a general curse upon the town of London
and its inhabitants, to a particular one directed with
menace against the able seaman who had captured
the stowaway, and at last, with directions that he
should be shown to the captain when the ship was in
the fairway and the anxious business of getting her
out was over.</p>

<p>For some little time, therefore, Demaine still stood
a butt for the occasional but half-exhausted ribaldry
of his two guardians, and not until the waterman&#8217;s
boat had dropped away from alongside and the
warping rope had splashed into the slime of the
Thames, not until the donkey engine had clanked
once more and got it aboard, horrible with all the
horrors of that water, and not until the engine
was going fairly and the <i>Lily</i> dropping swiftly
down the tide, was the captain ready to sit in
judgment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>Captain Higgins was a man who had made method
and self-control the hinges of success in life. <i>His</i>
Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia were all right!</p>

<p>Accuracy in accounts, faithfulness to employers, and
strict discipline aboard, were, as he was proud of repeating,
his motto. And when he heard that yet another
stowaway had claimed the hospitality of the <i>Lily</i>, he
betrayed no unusual perturbation but sat down at his
little desk, and ordered the prisoner to be brought in.</p>

<p>George, somewhat hurriedly introduced by both
arms between his now silent captors, perceived
sitting at that table a sight very different from that
which he had expected. He saw a very small, thin
man with a little pointed red beard and the eyes of
a weasel, wearing a well-used and somewhat dirty
peaked cap, upon the front of which was embroidered
a coat of arms long indistinguishable, and surrounded
by a scroll of tawdry and threadbare gold braid.</p>

<p>This was the individual upon whom Demaine&#8217;s
hopes of speedy restoration depended. He was
determined not to speak first, though he was certain
that the superior education of the officer would pierce
through his involuntary disguise.</p>

<p>Captain Higgins pulled out a large, official-looking
paper divided into certain mysterious compartments,
each headed with a printed rubric, and said briefly,
without looking up and with his pen ready to write:</p>

<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Demaine,&#8221; said George, with all the dignity he
could summon.... &#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; commanded Captain Higgins sharply,
still without looking up from the paper on which he
scratched rapidly and in an official manner: &#8220;Mane.&#8221;
&#8220;First name,&#8221; he chanted musingly, his pen suspended
to write further.</p>

<p>&#8220;George Mulross,&#8221; enunciated that individual, and
&#8220;George Ross&#8221; went down onto the sheet.</p>

<p>He began once more by clearing his throat, but
though he had not yet said a word, Captain Higgins
looked up with such an expression in his small and
unpleasing eyes as would brook no nonsense.</p>

<p>&#8220;George Ross Mane,&#8221; said he, speaking through
his nose. &#8220;You have been discovered on my ship,
the <i>Lily</i>, one thousand three hundred and twenty
tons burthen, London rating, bound from London to
Portland with agricultural and general cargo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Higgins loved these formalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no jew-risdiction in the matter....&#8221;
And here he began speaking by rote out of a dirty
little book in which were laid down the elements of
his trade: &#8220;Of-breach-of-contract-tort-replevin-stave-jury-or-execution-major-and-minor-nor-authority-to-act-savin&#8217;-always-and-exceptin&#8217;-in-such-way-as-and-whereby-discipline-accoutrement-good

Take-away-the-prisoner!
Gawd-save-the-King.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sentence, which was delivered in one breath
and with the rapidity of an expert, became towards
its close a torrent of syllables ending up sharp upon
the word &#8220;King&#8221; as upon a bell, and followed by a
stinging silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand,&#8221; shouted George in an uncontrolled
voice over his shoulder as they dragged him
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put him in irons!&#8221; cried Captain Higgins as
loudly as was consistent with order, discipline and
self-control. &#8220;Put the &mdash;&mdash; in irons!&#8221; And after
this natural exhibition of feeling (which in his heart
he regretted) the navigator returned to the bridge,
relieved the second officer there present, and continued
to take his ship down the fairway.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a little cubical space with iron sheeting above,
below and all round, and a dirty porthole still streaked
with the salt of the sea, the prospective Warden of
the Court of Dowry sat upon the floor in a despondent
mood.</p>

<p>There was already a slight swell upon the vessel;
his dungeon was far forward and he felt it to the full.
They had brought him some detestable mess or other
in a battered pannikin at noon. He had sent it away
untasted. Whither they were taking him, what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
be his fate, had formed for too many hours the
subject of his speculations.</p>

<p>The movement of the ship was beginning to drive
even these gloomy considerations from his mind.
He had already discovered two things: first that the
term &#8220;irons&#8221; was a purely conventional one; and
signified no more than that his harsh treatment
might be made indefinitely severe. Secondly, that
he was permitted to communicate with an extraordinarily
lop-sided boy of some fifteen years who
acted as general drudge in the ship and was deputed
to bring him his food from the galley. He was about
to discover a third feature in his new life.</p>

<p>A person evidently containing mixed the blood of
the Caucasian and of the Negroid races approached
him in his confinement and ordered him in broken
English to follow up on deck.</p>

<p>The sea air revived him somewhat, but George was
far from well when the half-breed, kicking towards
him a lump of something which reminded poor
Demaine of a diseased brick, a bucket of dirty water
and a large and peculiarly evil mop, bade him scrub.</p>

<p>But George&#8217;s first attempts at this new trade were
such that his overseer after looking at him first in
astonishment and then in anger, assured him that
any lack of good-will would necessarily be followed
by some form of physical compulsion, the which, so
far as his victim could gather from the torrent of
broken English, would probably consist in a larruping
with the rope&#8217;s end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Doggedly and despairingly the poor fellow scrubbed
away. He scrubbed perhaps too hard; at any rate
he produced a patch of surpassing brilliance though
of exiguous dimensions; and as the result of his
efforts turned faint and ill with something worse
than sea-sickness. He rose from his knees and
tottered to his legs, and began aimlessly swabbing
the odd patch of cleanliness with which he had
diversified the beastly decks of the <i>Lily</i>.</p>

<p>But the friend and brother (if I may so term the
Eurafrican) could bear no more, and seizing the
unstable landsman by the arm he thrust him,
stumbling, down the stairway, and locked him again
into his cell.</p>

<p>The exhaustion of nature had caused the unfortunate
politician to fall into a troubled doze, when
he was aroused by a gentle kick, and saw before him
the boy, the battered pannikin, a piece of bread which
had unfortunately dropped upon the deck aft of the
funnel on its way, and, within the tin, a peculiarly
loathsome liquid compound upon which, like the
magic island of Delos, floated at large a considerable
glob of fat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it,&#8221; said George feebly, &#8220;take it
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his surprise&mdash;if surprise is not too strong a word
for the faint emotions that still stirred him, the boy
began, as the conventional term goes, to look ugly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Na yer dahn&#8217;t!&#8221; he said, &#8220;yer dahn&#8217;t gemme inter
trouble, yer brute! Yer gort them two Newcastle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
men inter trouble, and the myte seyes yer nearly
gort im. And yer gort Blacky inter trouble; yer
dahn&#8217;t ger <i>me</i>! Yer gottereatit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; again said George feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer gottereatit!&#8221; repeated the boy, with that
dogged assumption of authority which so ill fits the
young. &#8220;By Gawd, if yer get cookie inter trouble,
I&#8217;ll ave the next watch dahn an&#8217; they&#8217;ll skin yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw it away,&#8221; said George, &#8220;there&#8217;s a good
boy. Throw it overboard. I&#8217;ll make it all right in
the long run,&#8221; he added, nodding encouragingly.</p>

<p>The boy looked doubtful. &#8220;I dursent,&#8221; he said
sullenly. &#8220;Sides which, ow&#8217;ll yer myke it all
roight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind,&#8221; whispered George mysteriously.
&#8220;You leave me the bread&mdash;I might try that ... the
clean part,&#8221; he added after a sudden wave of nausea&mdash;&#8220;but
chuck the rest, there&#8217;s a good lad. I can&#8217;t
bear it.&#8221; His whisper almost rose to a little scream....
&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy still continued to eye him doubtfully and
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer cawn&#8217;t myke it all roight!&#8221; he said, but he
bethought him that if the wretched prisoner could
not eat he should catch it from the cook just the
same, and that his own interest lay in the disposal
of the garbage. He drank a good swill of it himself&mdash;he
was not over-fed on the <i>Lily</i>,&mdash;went up on deck
for a moment,&mdash;and George could hear the splash
as the horror went overboard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>In a moment the boy had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer ought ter be griteful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve sived yer
a lickin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said George warmly, with his mouth
full. He had found himself able to munch the bread,
and it did him good.</p>

<p>The boy lingered; he took the same interest in
the stowaway that he might have taken in an animal
at the Zoological Gardens, and the episode broke the
monotony of his fourth voyage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;ll ketch it at Parham!&#8221; he said in a cheery tone.</p>

<p>George did not understand. &#8220;Why Parham?&#8221; he
asked weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coz that&#8217;s where they&#8217;ll land yer. That&#8217;s where
they&#8217;ll put yer shore. They&#8217;ll ave the cops there
roight on the quay wytin for yer, and they&#8217;ll put yer
ahverboard in the little dinghy, they wull: they wahn&#8217;t
thrah yer bundle arter ye, anforwhoy? acause yer
arn&#8217;t got none. But they&#8217;ll send one of th&#8217; orficers
and ee&#8217;ll and yer ahver ter th&#8217; cops, and ee&#8217;ll sye: &#8216;ee&#8217;s
been very vilent&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s what ee&#8217;ll sye; that&#8217;s what
they said wiv the larst un; and they clapped th&#8217;
darbies on <i>im</i> ... saw em meself,&#8221; continued the
boy most untruthfully. Then not knowing his man
and going a step too far, he continued: &#8220;Ee was ung,
ee was: ung in Lewes Gaol,&#8221; he ended, to give the
story point and finish.</p>

<p>The poor pedantry of maps does not weigh upon
the governing classes of this country, and Demaine
might have had some difficulty in answering in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
examination exactly where Parham lay, but he
knew that it was on the south coast, he knew one
reached it easily in an hour or two from London,
because he had gone to golf there. He knew that
there was a good motor track between the harbour
and Highcliff, and altogether Parham sounded to
him like an echo from now forgotten, dearer, and
long dead days. He affected indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s all the same to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the boy, not ready to relinquish the
delicious morsel, &#8220;sah yer sye! Ut wahn&#8217;t be th&#8217;
syme tomorrermornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; said George, with&mdash;what might
seem in such a man impossible&mdash;a touch of cunning
lent him by adversity, &#8220;Do you mean that this old
tub can make Parham in twenty-four hours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno bout arhs,&#8221; said the boy surlily, &#8220;an&#8217; she&#8217;s
norr a tub either&#8221; (for they have a curious loyalty
to their temporary homes), &#8220;but it&#8217;s a dy&#8217;s run. Any
fool knahs that,&#8221; he added courteously.</p>

<p>George dared not betray the hope that was rising
in his heart. Luckily for him the boy volunteered
his next information.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re orf Long Nahse now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I
dunno bout th&#8217; toide outsoide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said George, merely desiring to prolong
this all-important conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah: I dahn&#8217;t, I tell yer!&#8221; said the boy defiantly,
&#8220;nor there&#8217;s norr many does. I&#8217;ll lye yer dahn&#8217;t
yerself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>At this stage of the conversation and just as an
awkward pause interrupted it, a new terror struck
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh chise me!&#8221; he said, &#8220;look at yer tin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked George as he peered
into the empty tin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gorn empty,&#8221; whimpered the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, his spirits already improved
by the news of Parham, &#8220;what of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoy,&#8221; said the unhappy scullion, &#8220;Whoy, yer
cuddenever empty that tin&mdash;they&#8217;ll foind me aht!&#8221;
he said, and began to sniffle. &#8220;Wort are yer to
empty it wiv, yer fool? Yer eyn&#8217;t got a spoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say I licked it,&#8221; said George with attempted
humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d blieve ut of yer,&#8221; said the boy viciously,
&#8220;ye&#8217;re nothin but a woilbeast! Gettin us all
inter trouble!&#8221; He sniffled. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re a curse on
th&#8217; ship, that&#8217;s wort you are, an I blieve she&#8217;ll
founder. I blieve she&#8217;ll stroike in th&#8217; noight and go
to Ell. <i>You</i>&#8217;ll be drahwnded, anyow!&#8221; he viciously
added as he restrained his tears in prospect of the
wrath to come.</p>

<p>But the thought of safety which the mention of
Parham had brought revived George, and he bore
no ill-will. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll swab it out
with my bread and they&#8217;ll think I cleaned it up, but
it&#8217;s on condition that you chuck the bread overboard,&#8221;
he added.</p>

<p>The boy accepted the pact and was comforted. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was a cheap act of kindness, but he hoped it might
stand him in good stead a few hours later.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The June night fell gradually upon the sea, the slight
swell dropped to something almost imperceptible.
Through his miserable porthole George could see
great sheets of moonlight playing upon the easy
surface, and there was no noise but the regular thud
of the engine.</p>

<p>He fell into a profound sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS George Mulross Demaine drifted down river
in his cell that Tuesday afternoon the 2nd of
June, Dolly sat blankly in Downing Street with the
waters of despair at his lips.</p>

<p>Evil breeds evil.</p>

<p>As he considered the gloomy prospect, new aspects
of it rose before him. Not only was he privately
between these two fires, the sudden madness of the
outgoing Warden, the disappearance of his successor,
but the retirement of Charles Repton had been
publicly announced and Dimmy&#8217;s nomination had
appeared alongside with it in the morning papers.
The double news was all over England.</p>

<p>Yet another torturing thought suggested itself.
How and when should he fill the vacancy? What
was he to do?</p>

<p>Repton was impossible. His disaster was not in
the papers, thank God, and could not be, under the
decent rules which govern our press. But it was
already the chief tittle-tattle of every house that
counted in London. There could be no interregnum
with Repton still nominally filling the place. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
might wait as long as he dared, give it to a third
man, and then have Demaine turn up smiling and
hungry: and if that happened the Prime Minister
would earn what he dreaded most on earth, the
enmity of those who had been his friends; perhaps a
breach with Mary Smith herself.</p>

<p>He was not fit to do more than survey the
misfortune of the moment: he was still in his
perplexity, when he heard the bell ringing in the
next room, and was told that he himself was
personally and urgently wanted upon the telephone.</p>

<p>He put up his hand but the secretary would take
no denial; it was something absolutely personal.
Who was it from? It was from Lady Repton.</p>

<p>If it can be said of any wealthy and powerful man
that he ever betrays in his features or gait a purely
mental anxiety, then that might be said in some
degree of the unfortunate Prime Minister at that
moment. He suffered so acutely that his left lung,
the sense of which never wholly left him, seemed to
oppress him with actual physical pain.</p>

<p>He took the telephone, dreading what he might
hear.</p>

<p>It was a trifle less of a blow than he had expected.
All he heard was the agitated voice of Lady Repton
assuring him that she had waited as long as possible
before troubling him, but that she was now really
anxious, because Charles had not come home. Had
he gone in a taxi or a hansom, or how? It was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
than half an hour since the Prime Minister had
telephoned her, and Charles was always <i>so</i> regular.</p>

<p>It was perhaps weariness or perhaps a sense that
he could do nothing which made the Prime Minister
merely answer that he was sure to come in a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Repton has been very busy to-day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
has had a great deal on his mind. He has become
a little unhinged: that is the whole truth, Lady
Repton: nothing more. But I think he should be
carefully nursed. Pray do not be anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words faltered a little, for he himself was more
than anxious. Heaven only knew what Repton
might not be capable of, until they had got him safe
behind the four walls of his home.... And after
that the doctors.</p>

<p>He stopped the conversation a little rudely, by
taking advantage of a long pause to ring off. While
he was in the act of doing so a servant asked him in
the most natural manner in the world whether he
would not see Sir Charles Repton who was waiting
below.</p>

<p>I grieve to record that the young and popular
Prime Minister gave vent to the exclamation
&#8220;Good God!&#8221; For a moment he thought of
refusing to see him; then he heard coming up
through the distances of the official house a cheery
voice saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all very well for you, you&#8217;re a butler with
a regular place; when the Government goes out you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re a sort of permanent official. But
we...!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him up,&#8221; said the Prime Minister in a
qualm, &#8220;show him up at once. <i>At once!</i>&#8221; he
repeated, losing all dignity in his haste, and tempted
to push the solemn form of the domestic who stalked
upon his mission of doom as majestically as though
he were about to announce a foreign Ambassador, or
to give notice.</p>

<p>In a moment Charles Repton had entered.</p>

<p>He had bought, during his brief odyssey, a gigantic
Easter Lily in a Bond Street shop which sells such
ornaments. This blossom flourished in the lapel of
his coat and pervaded the whole room with its
perfume.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he shouted, running up to the
horrified Prime Minister and taking him by both
hands, &#8220;My dear fellow! Come, no pride; you know
as well as I do it&#8217;s all bunkum. Why, I could buy
and sell you any day of the week. It&#8217;s true,&#8221; he
mused, &#8220;there&#8217;s birth of course, but it&#8217;s a fair bargain.
Birth gives you your place and brains give me mine.
Do you mind smoking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, after which he said,
&#8220;No,&mdash;I don&#8217;t know ... I don&#8217;t care. Why didn&#8217;t
you go home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go home,&#8221; said Sir Charles solemnly, and
thinking what the reason was ... &#8220;didn&#8217;t ... go ... home,
because&mdash;Oh, I know, because I wanted
to talk to you about that peerage.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t talk so loud,&#8221; said Dolly
with real venom in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then I won&#8217;t,&#8221; shouted Sir Charles,
&#8220;though I really don&#8217;t see what there is to be
ashamed of. You&#8217;re going to give me a peerage and
I&#8217;m going to take one. You know as well as I do
that you didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d take one and I wasn&#8217;t
quite sure myself. Mind you, it&#8217;s free,&#8221; he added
coarsely, &#8220;gratis, <i>and</i> for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said the unhappy Premier,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I know, that&#8217;s the double-ruff dodge.
You won&#8217;t ask for anything, but old Pottle will.
And then when I come to you and complain you will
say you know nothing about it. Of course I shan&#8217;t
pay! It&#8217;ll be no good asking me; but what I want
is not to be <i>pestered</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister almost forced him down into
the chair from which he had risen, and said again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do talk lower, Repton. Do remember for a
moment where you are. No, certainly you shan&#8217;t be
bothered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else was there?&#8221; continued Sir Charles
genially, interrogating the ceiling and twiddling his
thumbs. &#8220;There was something, I know,&#8221; he continued,
looking sideways at the carpet.</p>

<p>He got up, walking slowly towards the door, and
still murmuring: &#8220;There was something else, I
know.&#8221; He touched his forehead with his hand,
stood still a moment as if attempting to remember,
then shook his head and said: &#8220;No, it&#8217;s no use. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was something to do with some concession or other,
but I&#8217;m not fit for business to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repton,&#8221; said Dolly in a tone which he rarely
used and had never found ineffectual, &#8220;don&#8217;t say
anything as you go out, don&#8217;t say anything to anybody.
Do get into a cab and go straight home.
You promised me you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep my promise,&#8221; said Sir Charles with fine
candour, &#8220;I always do. See if I don&#8217;t. Look here,
to please you I&#8217;ll make him drive across the Parade
here under your windows. There!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was true to his word. He did indeed dig
the servant in the ribs as that functionary handed him
his hat, his malacca cane and his gloves, he also wished
to see if the butler could wrestle, and he winked a
great wink at one of the footmen, but he said no word.
He jumped into the cab that was waiting for him, and
told the driver to go round by Delahaye Street onto
the Parade.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was cautiously watching from
a window to make sure that the new incubus upon his
life was on its way to incarceration, when he found
himself only too effectually assured: for he saw,
leaning out of a hansom which was going at a great
pace towards the Mall, a distant figure waving its hat
wildly and calling in tones that could be heard over
the whole space of the Parade:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m keeping my word, Dolly, I&#8217;m keeping my
word!&#8221;</p>

<p>So went Sir Charles Repton homeward, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
settled darkness gathered and fell upon the Premier&#8217;s
heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir Charles did keep his word.</p>

<p>He drove straight to his house, enlivening the way
by occasional whoops and shouting bits of secret
information very valuable to investors, to sundry
acquaintances whom he recognised upon the way.
At one point (it was during a block at the top of St.
James&#8217;s Street) he insisted on getting out for a
moment, seizing by the hand the dignified Lord
String who had advised the highest personages in
matters of finance, and telling him with a comical
grin that if he had bought Meccas that day on behalf
of the Great he had been most imprudent, for there
was an Arab rising and the big viaduct was cut&mdash;the
first misfortune that hitherto prosperous line had
suffered.</p>

<p>Near the Marble Arch a change came over him.
He felt a sudden and violent pain behind the ears,
and clapped his hands to the place. He did more:
when the spasm was over he put up the little door
and told the cabby; he made him a confidant; he
told him the pain had been very severe.</p>

<p>The driver, who was not sympathetic, replied in an
unsuitable manner, and they were in the midst of a
violent quarrel when two or three minutes later the
cabman, who was handicapped by having to conduct
his vehicle through heavy traffic, drove up to the house.</p>

<p>Lady Repton was waiting near the door; she sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
out no servant, she came out to the cab herself,
silenced the rising vocabulary of the driver with a
most unexpected piece of gold, and tripped up again
into the house.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was philosophising aloud upon the gold
band round his umbrella, letting his domestics
thoroughly understand the precise advantages and
disadvantages of such an ornament, when she took
him by the arm quite gently and began leading
him upstairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile in Downing Street an indispensable
secretary of the name of Edward was hearing what he
had to do.</p>

<p>Edward had been at King&#8217;s, for his father had sent
him there. From the Treasury which he adorned
he had been assumed by the Prime Minister, his
father&#8217;s chief college friend, and given the position of
private secretary; admirably did he fill its functions.</p>

<p>He was a silent Welshman, descended from a short
line of small squires, and he comprehended, in a
manner not wholly natural to a man under thirty, the
frailties of the human heart. The instructions he
received from his chief, however, were of the simplest
possible type, and called for the moment upon none
of his exceptional powers.</p>

<p>There was to be no writing and no telephoning:
he was to call upon Bowker, because Bowker had the
largest specialist experience of nervous diseases in
London, and therefore in the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>He was to come as from the Reptons, and to give
an appointment at Repton&#8217;s house, telling the doctor
that he should there find Sir Anthony Poole. He
was to go at once to Sir Anthony Poole, whose general
reputation stood higher than any other medical
man&#8217;s, to approach him as from the Reptons, to give
him a similar appointment and to inform him that he
would meet there Dr. Bowker. He was to tell them
the whole sad truth, and beg for a certificate. The
unfortunate gentleman could then be given the advantages
of a complete rest cure.</p>

<p>He was next to go to Lady Repton&#8217;s at once, and
ask her leave to call upon Dr. Bowker and Sir
Anthony Poole. She would give it: the Prime
Minister had no doubt of that. He was to suggest to
her the hour he had already named to those eminent
men. That very evening Sir Charles would be certified
a lunatic, and one load at least would be off the
Premier&#8217;s mind; and a load off his mind, remember,
was a load off his lung, and consequently an extension
of lease granted to a life invaluable to the State.</p>

<p>Within three-quarters of an hour Edward Evans
had done all these things. He had even cut matters
so fine that the physicians were to call at seven, and
Lady Repton would telephone the result&mdash;she dared
trust no other agency.</p>

<p>So far as a man in acute anxiety can be satisfied,
the young and popular Prime Minister was satisfied,
but his left lung was at least one-half of his being as
he went back again on his weary round to the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Commons, and the other half of his being was
fixed upon a contemplation of his fifty-fifth year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the door of Sir Charles Repton&#8217;s house was
drawn up an exceedingly neat brougham, and Dr.
Bowker had entered.</p>

<p>A few moments later there walked up to it the tall
strong frame of a man a trifle over-dressed but redeeming
such extravagances by a splendidly strong
old face, and he was Sir Anthony Poole.</p>

<p>Two things dominated the conceptions of Sir
Anthony: the first the antiquity of his family, which
was considerable; the second a healthy contempt for
the vagaries of the modern physical science.</p>

<p>He was himself as learned in his profession as any
man would care to be, but his common sense, he
flattered himself, was far superior to his learning,&mdash;and
he flattered himself with justice. He was a devout
Christian of some Anglican persuasion; his family
numbered thirteen sons and one daughter. His
income was enormous. I should add that a knowledge
of the world had taught him what real value
lay behind men like Sir Charles Repton, who had
stood the strain of public life and had found it possible
to do such great service to their country.</p>

<p>The mind of Dr. Bowker was dominated also by
two considerations: the first a permanent irritation
against the survival of those social forms which permitted
men an advantage purely hereditary; the
second a conviction, or rather a certitude, drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from clear thinking, that organisation and method
could deal with the cloudy blunders of mere general
knowledge as a machine can deal with dead matter,
or as an army can deal with civilians.</p>

<p>Dr. Bowker&#8217;s birth was reputable and sound; his
father had been a doctor before him in a country
town, and an earnest preacher in the local chapel;
his grandfather a sturdy miner, his great-grandfather
a turnkey in Nottingham Gaol.</p>

<p>He was therefore of the middle rank of society;
but after all, his social gospel such as it was weighed
upon him less than his scientific creed. He did
not <i>think</i>: he <i>knew</i>. What he did not know he
did not pretend to know. For the rest he was
always a little nervous and awkward in society,
and preferred the communion of his books and an
occasional spin upon a bicycle to the conversation
of the rich.</p>

<p>I should add that he revered Sir Charles Repton
not only as all men of the world must revere a great
statesman who has found it possible for many years
of the strain of public life to be of service to his
country, but also as a man of inestimable value in
proving that the solid Nonconformist stock could do
in administration, when it chose to enter that sphere,
what it had so triumphantly shown it could do in
commerce.</p>

<p>The two men were shown into an enormous room
on the ground floor where it was the custom of Sir
Charles (in happier days!) to receive those whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
feared or would inveigle. Lady Repton at once
joined them.</p>

<p>She was agitated; it was even distressing to watch
her agitation. She described to them the violent
pain which her husband had suffered twice, first the
yesterday evening just before dinner, next at this
moment on driving up to his house in a cab. She
described as best she could the situation of these
spasms of suffering, and she more than hinted that
she connected with them a novel and very astonishing
demeanour on her husband&#8217;s part which (here
she almost broke down) she hoped would justify
them in ordering him if necessary with their <i>fullest</i>
authority, to take a rest cure. She warned them
that she had told him nothing; she had always
heard it was wise in such cases. He thought they
had come merely as advisers upon the pains he had
felt behind the ear, but a few words of his conversation
would be enough to convince them of that much
graver matter.</p>

<p>She left them for a moment together, and went to
prepare her husband. She was a woman of heroic
endurance. Her father had been in his time a
God-fearing man, and had accumulated a small
competence in the jute line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dr. Bowker, let it be remembered, was a specialist
in nervous diseases. Sir Anthony Poole, let it also
be remembered, was not, but he was something
infinitely better in his own estimation: he was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who had attended more distinguished people and
with greater success than any other physician in
London. Dr. Bowker&#8217;s word as a specialist could not
be doubted. Sir Anthony Poole had only to express
an opinion upon a man&#8217;s health in any particular
and that opinion became positive gospel to all who
heard it.</p>

<p>The medical judgment of no two men given concurrently
could carry greater weight. By an accident
not infrequent in all professions, these two great men,
though their rivalry was not strictly in the same
field, each undervalued the scientific aptitude of the
other. Each would have gone to the stake for the
corporate value of that small ring to which both belonged,
but neither would admit the claim of the
other to a special if undefined precedence.</p>

<p>On the rare occasions when they met, however,
they observed all the courtesies of life, and on this
occasion in the large ground-floor room of Sir
Charles Repton&#8217;s house, they sat, when Lady Repton
had gone out, exchanging platitudes of a very
attenuated, refined sort, in a tone worthy of their
correct grooming and distinguished appearance. By
a singular inadvertence they were summoned together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Anthony,&#8221; said Dr. Bowker, bowing, smiling
and making a motion with his hand towards the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Bowker,&#8221; said Sir Anthony, copying the
courteous inclination, and thus it was that Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Anthony Poole had precedence, and first interrogated
Sir Charles Repton alone.</p>

<p>The conversation was brief. When Sir Charles
had answered the first questions very simply, that
he had two or three times in the last twenty-four
hours felt shooting pains behind the ear, he began to
speak in an animated way upon a number of things,
and described a humorous incident he had recently
witnessed in the Strand with a vigour highly suspicious
to so experienced a physician as Sir Anthony
Poole.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony asked him what he ate and drank,
received very commonplace answers, and was twice
assured by the Baronet, whose wife had used that
simple method to deceive him, that he had not for
weeks felt any return of his old complaint, and that
he only regretted that Lady Repton should have put
Sir Anthony to the trouble of calling. He understood
also that Dr. Bowker had been sent for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sir Anthony a little uneasily. &#8220;I
really imagined that the matter would be rather
worse than it seems to be. You know it is our
custom sometimes to call in another....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I know,&#8221; said Repton, with a slight smile,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a pity you called in old Bowker. I know he&#8217;s
very good at nerves or aches or something, but he&#8217;s
such an intolerable old stick. The fact is, Sir
Anthony,&#8221; he said, fixing that eminent scientist with
a keen look and slightly lowering his voice, &#8220;the
fact is, Dr. Bowker <i>isn&#8217;t quite a gentleman</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little severe,&#8221; said Sir Anthony, smiling,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a little severe, Sir Charles!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you,&#8221; added Repton, &#8220;I don&#8217;t say anything
against him in his professional capacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Sir Anthony.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are cases when a man&#8217;s manners do
make a difference,&mdash;especially in your profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Anthony beamed. &#8220;Well, Sir Charles,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to hear it&#8217;s no worse,&#8221;&mdash;and as Sir
Anthony went out he muttered to himself: &#8220;No
more mad than I am; but he mustn&#8217;t go talking
like that about other people.&#8221; And the physician
chuckled heartily.</p>

<p>Dr. Bowker&#8217;s introduction to, and private stay
with, the patient was briefer even than had been Sir
Anthony&#8217;s. He chose for his gambit the remark:
&#8220;Sir Anthony Poole has just seen you I believe, Sir
Charles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes he has,&#8221; answered Charles Repton in a
pleasant and genial tone, &#8220;yes he has, Dr. Bowker,
though why,&#8221; he added, with a happy laugh, &#8220;I
can&#8217;t conceive. After all, if I wanted a doctor for
any reason I should naturally send to a specialist.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sir Charles had answered the next few questions
very simply, that he had two or three times in
the last twenty-four hours felt shooting pains behind
the ear, he then reverted to his praise of the specialist.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had any nervous trouble, for instance, Dr.
Bowker, I should send for you. If I had trouble
with my tibia, I should send for Felton.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>Dr. Bowker nodded the most vigorous approval.
It was evident that Sir Charles Repton&#8217;s considerable
if superficial learning was standing him in good
stead.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had trouble with my aural ducts I should
send for Durand, or,&#8221; he continued, in the tone of
one who continues to illustrate a little pompously,
&#8220;if my greater lymphatics were giving me trouble,
Pigge is the first name that would suggest itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Bowker&#8217;s enthusiasm knew no bounds. &#8220;You
are quite right, Sir Charles,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are quite
right.&#8221; He almost took the Baronet&#8217;s hand in the
warmth of his agreement. &#8220;If more men&mdash;I will
not say of your distinction and position, but if more
people&mdash;er&mdash;of what I may call the&mdash;er&mdash;directing
brain of the nation, were of your opinion, it would
be a good day for Medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now a man like Poole,&#8221; went on Charles Repton
nonchalantly, &#8220;what does he know, what <i>can</i> he
know, about any particular trouble? And mind
you, an educated man always knows in more or less
general terms what his particular trouble is. Why
Poole&mdash;well....&#8221; Here Sir Charles ended with a
pitying little smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; said Dr. Bowker, bursting with
assent, &#8220;I understand the old trouble has not
returned. And if it had, as you very well said,
it would be Felton&#8217;s job rather than mine. Of
course it has a nervous aspect; everything has, but
every specialist has his own field.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>And Dr. Bowker went out, communing with
himself and deciding that the foolish anxiety of
wives might be an excellent thing for the profession,
but was hardly fair upon the purses of their
husbands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sir Anthony?&#8221; said Dr. Bowker as he
entered the ground-floor room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dr. Bowker?&#8221; said Sir Anthony with a
responsive smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t see why they sent for us,&#8221; said
Dr. Bowker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thoroughly agree,&#8221; said Sir Anthony Poole.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more to be done, I think?&#8221; said
Dr. Bowker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Sir Anthony Poole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we speak to Lady Repton?&#8221; said Dr.
Bowker.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll write her,&#8221; said Sir Anthony Poole.</p>

<p>They took leave of Lady Repton in a solemn and
sympathetic manner, assuring her that it was better
to give their impression in writing, and that she
should receive it in the course of that evening. And
having so fulfilled their mission, these two eminent
men went off together with a better feeling between
them than either would have thought possible an
hour before.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a singularly intelligent man,&#8221; said Sir
Anthony Poole as they parted at the door of Dr.
Bowker&#8217;s Club, &#8220;a singularly intelligent man. Of
course one would have expected it from his position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
but I did not know until to-day how really remarkably
intelligent and cultivated he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thoroughly agree with you,&#8221; said Dr. Bowker,
taking his leave, &#8220;he is what I call....&#8221; He sought
a moment for a word.... &#8220;He is what I call a really
cultivated and intelligent man.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening Lady Repton received a short but
perfectly clear opinion signed by both these first-class
authorities, that her husband was in the full
possession of his faculties, and that it would be the
height of imprudence to set down any extravagance
of temper or momentary zeal upon any particular
question to mental derangement or to connect it
with a slight accidental headache.</p>

<p>Lady Repton in her grievous anxiety (for at the
very moment she read the message she heard Sir
Charles talking to a policeman out of a window,
and telling him that it was ridiculous to try and
look dignified in such a uniform), Lady Repton I
say, at her wits&#8217; end for advice, was bold enough to
ring up the Prime Minister whom she hardly knew,
and to tell him all: There was no chance of a
certificate; what, oh what should she do?</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was not sympathetic. He
did not desire further acquaintance with the lady.</p>

<p>The Premier&#8217;s cup was full. His Warden of the
Court of Dowry had resigned: the new Warden
was appointed. The Warden who had resigned
had gone mad; the Warden whom he had appointed
had fled. At least&mdash;at least he might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
spared the madman! But no, he was not granted
even this! the madman was still loose over London
like a roaring lion, capable of doing infinite things
within the next twenty-four hours. What was a
peerage to a madman? What was a Wardenship
of the Court of Dowry to a man who was not? The
crumb of comfort that would have been afforded
him by locking up the wretched lunatic who was
the root of half his troubles was snatched from
him.</p>

<p>It was enough to make a man cut his throat.</p>

<p>So ended that dreadful Tuesday in Downing
Street, and all night long between his fits of tortured
and horror-stricken sleep wherein his left lung and
his fifty-fifth year were the baleful demons of his
dreams, the young and popular Prime Minister
would wake in a cold sweat and imagine some
new horror proceeding from Repton let loose.</p>

<p>The summer night is short. Wednesday most
gloriously dawned, and after two hours of attempted
slumber under the newly risen light, the Prime
Minister arose, a haggard man.</p>

<p>The lines on either side of the young Prime
Minister&#8217;s mouth had grown heavier during the
suffering of the night.</p>

<p>Had he been married and had his wife felt for him
that affection which his character would surely have
called forth she would have been anxious to observe
the change. But such is the strain of political life
and such the ambitions it arouses, that his suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
passed unnoticed with the majority, and with the
rest was a subject for secret congratulation.</p>

<p>He was down very early. Before he had eaten he
went rapidly and nervously into his secretary&#8217;s room
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news, Edward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his secretary, looking if possible more
nervous than his chief, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say there is.
The <i>Herald</i> is advertising an interview with Repton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Herald</i>!&#8221; said the Prime Minister between
his set teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the <i>Herald</i>,&#8221; answered the secretary, &#8220;it
really doesn&#8217;t much matter,&#8221; he continued wearily,
(he had been up most of the night) &#8220;if it wasn&#8217;t the
<i>Herald</i> it would be somebody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must pot &#8217;em as they come,&#8221; answered the
Premier grimly, &#8220;and the <i>Herald</i> won&#8217;t publish that
interview at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let them publish it,&#8221; said the secretary....
&#8220;I&#8217;ll write it if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I mean,&#8221; said the Prime Minister.
&#8220;I mean they won&#8217;t publish what people think they
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Evans, &#8220;they won&#8217;t.... He&#8217;s been
shouting out of a window,&#8221; the secretary went on by
way of news.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he been shouting?&#8221; he breathed
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh just insults, nothing important, but the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
have complained. And late last night he pointed
out Betswick, who was a little buffy, stumbling down
the pavement&mdash;sitting down, some say&mdash;. He shouted
from his window to a lot of people in the street that
it was Betswick. And now Betswick is afraid of
going to open the Nurses&#8217; Home this afternoon....
It&#8217;s a damned shame!&#8221; ended the secretary, exploding.
&#8220;What the devil are you to do with a man ... it&#8217;s
like&mdash;it&#8217;s like&mdash;it&#8217;s like an anarchist with little packets
of dynamite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you looked at the papers yet, Edward?&#8221;
asked the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of &#8217;em,&#8221; answered his secretary gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing in the <i>Times</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;nothing in any of the
eleven London papers on the official list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the others count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the secretary thoughtfully, &#8220;there
are the two evening papers that have been making
such a fuss about the Concessions in Burmah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
desperate remedy, but take the paper you have here,
write out a note and get them to lunch. Not with
me&mdash;with you. They&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch is no good,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evening papers go to press in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they indeed?&#8221; said the Prime Minister, with
the first lively glance he had delivered since the
beginning of this terrible debacle. &#8220;That&#8217;s really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
worth knowing! I never knew that.&#8221; He gazed
into space, then suddenly waking up he said: &#8220;Why
then, Edward, there&#8217;s no time to lose! Go and see
them at once. Go and see them yourself, Edward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much good,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;I know one
of them, and the other&#8217;s dotty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, &#8220;never
mind. Do it somehow. Kill &#8217;em if you must,&#8221; he
added jocosely, and his secretary went.</p>

<p>The Premier left his secretary&#8217;s room and mournfully
approached his breakfast.</p>

<p>Upon his table a time-honoured device constructed
of brass and wood was designed to hold the newspaper
while the tenant of that historic house might
be at meals. Upon this was propped up, open at
the leading page, a copy of the <i>Times</i>. The leaders
were discreet. He found no word from beginning
to end, save a little note in small type to the effect
that Sir Charles Repton would be unable to speak
at the great Wycliffite Congress, he was confined to
the house with influenza; a similar note he was
assured had appeared in all the eleven newspapers
upon the official list, and through them would be
distributed to the provincial press; the only thing
left to the discretion of their editorial departments
being the disease from which the distinguished patient
might be suffering, which appeared in one as phlebitis,
in another as tracheotomy, and in a third as a severe
cold.</p>

<p>Of Demaine not a word.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>Dolly thanked Heaven for the discipline which
makes the Press of London the most powerful
instrument of Government in the world.</p>

<p>His thanks were premature; and the gentle, somewhat
mournful atheism which was his only creed
received excellent support when he saw among certain
items of news which were laid upon his table every
morning, two cuttings from foreign papers which told
at great length and in the plainest details the whole
story of the dreadful episode in the City, and connected
it in so many words with the scandalous scene
in the House of Commons. He could only comfort
himself by reflecting that news which leaked out
abroad was rarely if ever permitted to enter the
Island. He reflected that time is a remedy for all
evils, and he made ready for the duties of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile his secretary, Edward,&mdash;to give him
his full title, Teddy Evans&mdash;had come to the first of
the two offices which it was his business to visit. It
was not yet nine o&#8217;clock and there was still time to
cut on the machine.</p>

<p>At the Treasury Evans had written regularly for a
large evening paper,&mdash;he knew his way about such
an organism. He betrayed no undue haste, well
knowing the subtle delight the menials would have
before such a display of retarding his every effort,
and when the fat man, Mr. Cerberus, who keeps the
door of the <i>Capon</i> offices, had pushed to him a dirty
scrap of paper on which he was to write his name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
business, he quietly asked for an envelope as well.
It was given him with some grumbling.</p>

<p>He wrote his message: &#8220;If you have begun machining,
stop. I&#8217;ve been sent up here urgently.&mdash;E. E.&#8221;</p>

<p>He closed it, gummed it down, and waited. He
had not ten seconds to wait. A young man who
looked and was underfed, a gaunt tall young man
with hair as long and as dank as the waving weeds
of the sea, received him with immense solemnity. It
was not often that affairs of State came his way.
One such had come earlier in that very year. It had
been the occasion of his lunching with the exalted
individual who now sat before him, and he had
never forgotten it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Evans,&#8221; he said rather pompously, lifting his
left hand and fixing two large burning, feverish eyes
upon the secretary, &#8220;this place is the confessional.
Anything you say shall be sacred ... absolutely
sacred!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Evans was cheery enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing of any importance,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but,
well, I&#8217;m a great friend of the Reptons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the editor sympathetically, which
was odd, for Evans only just knew the Reptons&#8217;
address from having to write them letters, and the
Reptons only just knew the look of Evans&#8217; face from
having once had to ask him to a dinner of an
official sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; went on Evans unblushingly (how valuable
are men of this kind!), &#8220;I am a great friend, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of dear old Lady Repton&mdash;through my mother,&#8221; he
added in an explanatory tone, &#8220;but I won&#8217;t go into
that. The point is this: the whole family are really
dreadfully concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; said the editor of the <i>Capon</i>, still
most sympathetic, and most grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Evans with affected ill-ease, &#8220;the fact
is we don&#8217;t want anything said about it at all&mdash;nothing.
That&#8217;s the simplest way, after all. It&#8217;s a
great trouble. You really would do me a personal
service, and they would be so grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said the editor of the <i>Capon</i>. He
turned to a speaking-tube upon his right and was
about to pull out the whistle, when a violent blast
blew that instrument at the end of its chain into his
face. The editor expressed disgust, and when this
expression was over, asked for the statement. The
statement was brought.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re waiting for the machine, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The editor ran his blue pencil down the list, made
a little X against one item, and said: &#8220;Bring me a
proof of that, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A slip of proof came up: it was to the effect that
Sir Charles Repton was to speak at the Wycliffite
Congress and from his candid and vigorous action
of the day before, both in the House and outside it,
it was hoped that his address would act as a clarion
call in the present crisis of religion. (&#8220;And it
would!&#8221; thought Edward, all goose-flesh at the
thought).</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s no harm in that,&#8221; he said. Then with
sudden thought: &#8220;What&#8217;s the leader about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Concessions,&#8221; said the editor of the <i>Capon</i>,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Evans, &#8220;we don&#8217;t agree about that, do
we?&#8221; And he smiled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I leave general orders about Repton items
during the day?&#8221; said the editor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yes,&#8221; said Evans, and then remembering his
little subterfuge he added: &#8220;Don&#8217;t print anything
unless it&#8217;s directly from the family. You understand
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said the editor. &#8220;Riggles, the
sub-editor will be in charge after this. I&#8217;m going
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrote in a large hand upon a large sheet of
paper: &#8220;No Repton items, not even Press Agency,
except from the house itself. F. D.&#8221;&mdash;for his name
was Francis Davis. &#8220;Take that to Mr. Riggles,&#8221;
he said to the devil, and the two men went out
together.</p>

<p>Well knowing that Davis&#8217; house lay in the extreme
of the suburbs, and that he himself was going into
the heart of Fleet Street, Evans offered to give his
companion a lift. To his disgust it was accepted,
and he was constrained to drive the editor of the
<i>Capon</i> to St. Paul&#8217;s Station; it lost him ten minutes,
and those ten minutes were nearly fatal. For when
he had got back at full speed to the offices of the
<i>Moon</i>, the paper had gone to press. The machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were shaking and thundering away in the basement,
and mile after mile of diffused culture was pouring
out in a cataract to feed the divine thirst for
knowledge.</p>

<p>It seemed too late, but Evans went boldly through
it all the same. The editor was gone, but to the
sub-editor he sent in his card and wrote upon it
&#8220;From the Prime Minister.&#8221; It was a time needing
heroic measures.</p>

<p>He asked to see an advance copy. The leader
was Repton&mdash;Repton&mdash;Repton, nothing but Repton....
Repton had given away the wickedness of
modern finance; Repton for purposes of his own
was prepared to expose the mockery of our politics;
Repton would tell them the truth about the Concessions;
they had a promise of an interview with
Repton. What motives might have caused Repton
to act as he had done they could not determine.
It was sufficient for them that Repton, etc....</p>

<p>The leader had a title, and the title of the leader
was Repton. It had coined a new word: the word
was &#8220;to Reptonise,&#8221; upon the model of &#8220;to peptonise.&#8221;
The <i>Moon</i> threatened to reptonise the whole of our
public life.</p>

<p>Evans spent about thirty seconds looking at the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can they stop the machines, Mr. Price?&#8221; he
asked, for Price was the sub-editor&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the sub-editor, &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans walked to the window and looked out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
into the City street and said without showing his
face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Price, your proprietor is a very valued
member of our party.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the word &#8220;proprietor,&#8221; Mr. Price changed
colour. Yet Evans had not meant the proprietor
of Mr. Price, he had merely meant the proprietor of
the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Price, I will tell you all&#8221; (and he told him
more than all!). &#8220;Your proprietor left for Canada
during the Easter Recess; he was taken ill in
Montreal; he is on his way back, and he will be
home next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Price nodded and at the same time inwardly
admired the omniscience of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Price,&#8221; continued Edward, still gazing
at the street opposite, &#8220;there is the promise of a
peerage. These things are hardly ever mentioned,
and I tell it to you quite frankly. If that leader
appears,&#8221;&mdash;turning round sharply&mdash;&#8220;the peerage will
not be conferred, and your proprietor shall be told
that that leader was the cause of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Evans,&#8221; began the sub-editor blankly.</p>

<p>Evans was suddenly determined. It was astonishing
to see the change in the man. His conduct
and attitude would have seemed remarkable to the
most indifferent observer: to one who knew that the
proprietor of the <i>Moon</i> had never been, until that
moment, within five hundred miles of a peerage, it
would have seemed amazing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Price,&#8221; said Evans rapidly and very clearly,
&#8220;you are in a cleft stick. If you don&#8217;t print your
present issue, if you must delay it, it will cost your
proprietor a heavy sum directly and indirectly. I
know that. But if you <i>do</i> print it will cost him no
money, but....&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Price thought of the little home at Peckham;
of the three young Prices, of Mrs. Price and of
sundry affections that grow up in the most arid and
most unexpected soils: he was in an agony as to
which course would least destroy him: he made one
last appeal:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have it in writing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; said Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Evans,&#8221; said the sub-editor
humbly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stop the machines,&#8221; and with a heavy
heart he rang the bell.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the <i>Moon</i> came out an hour
later than usual, and that the leader dealt at so
singular a moment with the pestilent vices of the
King of Bohemia, and with his gross maladministration
of Spitzbergen which it summoned to the bar of
European opinion.</p>

<p>Those who have wondered why Edward, without
previous training so soon after this incident was
made a partner of the great bank he now adorns,
would wonder less if they had been present at that
interview.</p>

<p>The press was safe.</p>

<p>That the agencies were safe went of course without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
saying. Block A (as a group of eight papers owned
by one man is familiarly called by permanent
officials) had been squared, the day before. Block B,
another group of six owned by a friend of his,
was for private reasons unable to publish news of
this kind. The <i>Evening German</i> wouldn&#8217;t dare, and
the <i>Bird of Freedom</i> wouldn&#8217;t know. The <i>Press</i> was
safe so far as Repton was concerned.</p>

<p>But what about Demaine?</p>

<p>The <i>Herald</i> had been informed pretty sharply
that it was compelled for unavoidable reasons to
postpone its interview with Sir Charles Repton.
The very paragraph had been written out by
Edward, and the <i>Herald</i> had swallowed the pill.</p>

<p>But what about Demaine?</p>

<p><i>That</i> had got ahead of them, and there was
nothing to do but to wait until Demaine should be
found. The very moment that he was found they
could act and an explanation should be given that
would soon cause the mystery to be forgotten. But
a silence still surrounded that unlucky name.</p>

<p>Nothing had been heard in the Lobbies, nothing
from Scotland Yard. Finally, and more important,
Mary Smith herself could tell Dolly nothing, and
if <i>she</i> could not, certainly no one else in London
could.</p>

<p>She was really fond of her cousin, and for his
sake she comforted, and, what was more important,
restrained the imprudent Sudie.</p>

<p>As for Ole Man Benson, beyond a natural regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that such an asset as a son-in-law in the Cabinet
was still held over as a contingent and that he
could not for the moment close upon the option,
he took the matter in a calm and philosophical
spirit.</p>

<hr class="chap" />







<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;OH Liberty!&#8221; says the Bulgarian poet
Machinchose in a fine apostrophe, too little
known in this country. &#8220;Oh Liberty,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Never had George Mulross Demaine known the
sweets of that word in the days when he enjoyed
its privilege to the full. Now, as the brilliant dawn
of that Wednesday awakened him upon the deep he
learned the beauty of Freedom.</p>

<p>Its meaning saturated his very being as he woke
in his miserable cell, refreshed but very weak, and
saw shafts of the happy morning sun coming level
with the dancing of the sea, and making a rhythmic
change of unreal network in the oval patch of light
that was cast by the porthole against the filthy rust
of the walls.</p>

<p>He felt mechanically for his watch and found
nothing but bare skin; then (such a teacher is
adversity!) he to whom induction was grossly
unfamiliar, began to induce away like any child
of Nature.</p>

<p>The sunlight was level, for the image of the porthole
upon the wall was but little lower than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
porthole itself:&mdash;therefore the sun had but just
risen.</p>

<p>It was June, therefore if the sun had but just
risen the hour was very early: how early he
certainly could not have answered if you had asked
him a week ago, but adversity, that admirable
schoolmistress, was developing the mind of George
Mulross as the blossom of a narcissus develops
under the first airs of Spring, and he was capable
of remembering a sunrise after the ball at the
Buteleys&#8217;, and another after a big supper at Granges&#8217;.
He was in bed before half-past five on each occasion.
It must therefore be between four and five
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;solstice&#8221; was unfamiliar to this
expectant member of the British Executive, but he
seemed to remember that somewhere about this time
of year the nights were at their shortest.</p>

<p>He was full of a new pride as he made these
discoveries. Then two things struck him at once:
the first that he was ravenously hungry, the second
that all motion of the ship had ceased. He heard
no sound of any kind except the gentle lapping of
the tiny waves alongside, for it was calm except
for the little breeze of morning.</p>

<p>He attempted with his new-found powers to pass
the time in further induction, to guess by the
position of the light how the ship lay, but as he had
forgotten at which end of a ship the anchor is let
go, and as he had no notion of the tide in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
English Channel, nor even whether tides ran for
six hours or twelve (he was sure it was one of the
two), and as, in general, he was grossly ignorant of
the data upon which such an induction should
proceed, the effort soon fatigued him. He was
content to prop himself up against the wall and
crave for food.</p>

<p>He heard a step outside, he struck the door with
his fist. To his delight a key turned in it, and
the doubtful visage of the boy once more appeared.
Early as was the hour, and divine the weather, the
boy was still gloomy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gettin&#8217; us inter more trouble, orl on us, yer dirty
skunk!&#8221; was his greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I only
knocked because I&#8217;m so terribly hungry. Can&#8217;t
you get me something to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yus,&#8221; said the boy thoughtfully, &#8220;I dahn&#8217;t think!
Yer&#8217;d myke me chuck it. Yer&#8217;s particler as a
orspital nuss,&#8221; he added, with a recollection of a
brazen woman in gaudy uniform whom a kind lady
had thrust upon his mother&#8217;s humble home just before
he had gone aboard.</p>

<p>Demaine was in acute necessity. &#8220;Look here,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;get me some bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whaffor?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>Demaine nodded mysteriously, and once again
was his gaoler torn between a desire for some
ultimate gain and the certitude that no present
gain was obtainable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>He was a London lad, with all the advantages
that London birth implies, and it had already
occurred to him that Demaine&#8217;s accent, manner and
cuticle differed in a strange way from those of your
stock stowaway. He had been impressed in the
matter of the food; he was more impressed by
certain little turns of language which he associated
with those hateful, but, as he had been told, wealthy
people, who came down and did good amid his
mother&#8217;s neighbours in the East End; and when
he had thought it well over and tamed his prisoner
further by one more well-chosen epithet, he went
off and came back with a hunk of bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer lucky,&#8221; he said as he returned, &#8220;thet
yer on a short trip. Otherwyes t&#8217;d uv been
biscuit....&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;and gryte wurms
in ut!&#8221;</p>

<p>George did not reply. He bit into the bread in
ecstasy, and his eyes, which his acquaintances in
London commonly discovered to be lifeless, positively
gleamed upon this summer morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;They gotter communicyte wiv the orfferities fust,&#8221;
said the boy pompously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said George with his mouth full.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! yus, it is!&#8221; sneered the boy, who thought
there was something of the toff in this use of the
simply affirmative. &#8220;An&#8217; after that they&#8217;ll land yer,
and yer&#8217;ll ave the darbies on afore breakfast-toime.&#8221;
He added nothing this time about hanging. The
details of the moment were too absorbing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>&#8220;How do you mean &#8216;communicate&#8217;?&#8221; asked
George carelessly and all ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woy, wiv a flag, that&#8217;s ow,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>Demaine had often been told of the long and
complicated messages which little pieces of bunting
could convey, and he had himself presented to a
country school a whole series of flags which, in a
certain order, signified that England expected every
man to do his duty. But he could not conceive
how so complete a message as the presence and
desired arrest of an unfortunate stowaway could be
conveyed to the authorities ashore by any such
simple means, unless indeed the presence of stowaways
was so common an occurrence that a code
signal was used for the purpose of disembarking
that cargo.</p>

<p>The boy illumined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They got th&#8217; flag up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;syin&#8217; &#8216;Send a
baht,&#8217; and when they sees it they&#8217;ll run up one
theirselves&mdash;then&#8217;s yer toime.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the boy&#8217;s information, as is common with the
official statements of inferiors, was grossly erroneous.</p>

<p>A voice came bawling down from above, ordering
him to tumble up with the prisoner.</p>

<p>Tumble up George did; that is, he crawled up
the steep and noisome ladder, and as he put his
head out into the glorious air, thought that never
was such contrast between heaven and hell. He
drank the air and put his shoulders back to it, to
the risk of the green-black coat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>George Mulross was one of those few men who
have never written verse, but he was capable that
moment if not of the execution at least of the
sentiment which the more classical of my readers
are weary of in Prom. Vinc. Chor. A. 1-19, Oh the
god-like air! The depth and the expanse of sky!</p>

<p>The fatherly sky was all light, the sun was
climbing, and a vivid belt of England lay, still
asleep, green and in repose under that beneficence;
and in the midst of it, set all round with fields, lay
a lovely little town. It was Parham.</p>

<p>Demaine had once or twice noted how strangely
glad the houses of men seem from off the sea, but
as he was familiar rather with Calais and Dover,
with Ostend, Folkestone and Boulogne than with
other ports, and as he had more often approached
them in winter weather than in the London season,
there was something miraculously new to him in
this vision which had been the delight of his forefathers:
England from the summer sea.</p>

<p>The clear spirit bubbling within him encountered
another and muddier but forceful current as his eyes
fell upon the first officer.</p>

<p>That individual surveyed him with hatred but
did not deign to throw him a word. He bade the
lad stand by George in a particular place upon the
deck till he should be sent for; he next threatened
several of the boy&#8217;s vital organs if his prisoner were
not properly kept in view, and having pronounced
these threats, lurched away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&#8220;Th&#8217; old man&#8217;ll want yer soon, ter fill in is sheet,&#8221;
said the lad by way of making conversation.
&#8220;Myebe ee&#8217;ll ave ye larrupped, myebe ee wahn&#8217;t. Ee
didn&#8217;t the larst un,&#8221; he put in as an afterthought, as
though it were the custom to larrup some seven
stowaways out of eight by way of parting, and to
make capricious exception of certain favourites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;ll ave to tyke thut sheet wiv yer; leastwyes
whoever&#8217;s in charge of the baht&#8217;ll ave ter, an thye

reglar. Otherwyes they cudden put yer awye&mdash;and
they&#8217;re bahnd ter do that: not arf!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Demaine was not heeding the discomforting
comment of his warder. He was balancing in his
mind the poor chances of the morning, and as he
balanced them they seemed blacker with every
moment.</p>

<p>The shore was perhaps half a mile away: the
hour say five, perhaps half-past. By six, or half-past
six at the latest, the earliest people in Parham
would be astir.</p>

<p>The fixed inveterate hope of the governing class
that a gentleman can always get out of a hole, had
dwindled within him to that dying spark to which
it dwindles during invasions and at the hour of
death.</p>

<p>He did not trust his accent, he did not trust his
skin, he did not trust his parentage, he did not
trust his wealth&mdash;alas, his former wealth!&mdash;to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
more accurately, his wife&#8217;s former wealth,&mdash;to speak
still more accurately, the former wealth of his wife&#8217;s
father.</p>

<p>He trusted nothing but blind chance, his muscles
and flight.</p>

<p>He hated the vision which was in immediate
prospect of the little weasel-faced captain with his
pointed red beard, reciting by rote yet another
string of idiotic sentences from a manual; he hated
the vision of the next step, the men in blue, with
their violence and their closing of his mouth by
brutal means. Whether he could convince a
magistrate he did not pause to inquire. The way
was too long&mdash;it was a dark corridor leading to
Doom.</p>

<p>He heard a second voice calling the boy to the
accompaniment of oaths quite novel and individual
and in a high voice that he had not yet heard, and
he thought that his hour had come.</p>

<p>But the boy&#8217;s reply undeceived him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi dursn&#8217;t!&#8221; he yelled down the decks, &#8220;Oi
gotter look arter th&#8217; Skunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, thought George bitterly, he already
had a fixed traditional name aboard the <i>Lily</i>, like
Blacky and the Old Man.</p>

<p>The cook, for it was he, emerged from the galley
aft, stood in the brilliant sunlight and delivered rapid
blasphemy with tremendous velocity and unerring
aim.</p>

<p>The boy whimpered and was irresolute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>If the threats of the mate had been less practical,
those of the cook might have had less effect, but
between the prospect of the excision of his liver and
of a series of hearty buffets and mighty kicks endways,
what reasonable youth would hesitate in a
civilisation such as ours?</p>

<p>The boy faltered visibly, and turning upon the Skunk
informed him once again that he was always gettin&#8217;
people inter trouble. Nay, more, he threatened to
pay out the innocent cause of his despair for the
divided duty in which he found himself.</p>

<p>The cook re-emerged; he had fixed on a new belt
of ammunition and began firing in a manner if
possible more direct and devastating and quite as
rapid, as that which had distinguished the first volley.
And the boy, who was, after all, more directly the
servant of the cook than of any one else on board,
wavered and broke. With a clear statement of the
consequences should Demaine move an inch from
the spot, and a promise to return before a man could
spit to leeward, the boy dashed off to the galley,
and for perhaps five seconds, perhaps ten, the
prospective Warden of the Court of Dowry was
free.</p>

<p>The movement of the human mind, says Marcus
Aurelius (imitative in this sentence, as in most of
his egregious writings), resembles that of a serpent.</p>

<p>There are serpents and serpents. Minds of
Demaine&#8217;s type move commonly with the motion
of a gorged python but just roused from sleep; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
even the python will, under compulsion, dart,&mdash;and,
in those five seconds, not reason but an animal
instinct drove the politician&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>He was up, on to the bale, over the bulwark and
down ten feet into the sea, before he had even had
time to formulate a plan. He could swim, and that
was enough for him.</p>

<p>The splash made by Demaine&#8217;s considerable form
as it displaced in an amount equal to his weight the
waters of the English Channel, came to the ears of
the Watch, who was leaning comfortably over the
farther railing at the other end of the vessel, looking
out to seaward and ruminating upon a small debt
which he had left behind him in the parish of
Wapping. With no loss of dignity the Watch
shuffled forward to see whether aught was displaced.
The splash had been a loud one, but it might have
been something thrown from the galley.</p>

<p>He first of all looked carefully over the starboard
bow to seaward. There was no foam upon the water:
everything was still. It occurred to him to cross
the deck; he did so in a leisurely manner and
thought he noted far down the side, and already
drifting astern with the tide, a rapidly disappearing
ring of foam. He was a stupid man (though I say
it that shouldn&#8217;t, for he came from Bosham, noble
and fateful Mistress of the Sea), and he looked at the
ring of foam in a fascinated manner, considering
what could have caused it, until he was roused to
life and to his duties by the thunder of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
officer who from the bridge demanded of him in
perfectly unmistakable language what he had done
to the Skunk.</p>

<p>The sense of innocence was so strong in the honest
seafaring soul that he replied by a simple stare which
almost gave the first officer a fit, and in the midst
of the language that followed, the boy, positively
pale with fear, came tearing from the galley and
found, not his charge, but the Bosham man gazing
like a stuck pig at his superior above, and at the
world in general.</p>

<p>The reappearance of the boy was a welcome relief
to the chief officer&#8217;s lungs and intelligence; it added
fuel to his flame. He very nearly leapt down from
the bridge in his paroxysms of wrath, and heaven
only knows what he would have done to the wretched
lad whom he would render responsible for the misadventure
had he not at that moment caught sight
of a little speck upon the sunlit water far astern: it
was the head of George Mulross Demaine, battling
with fate.</p>

<p>The prospective Warden of the Court of Dowry
could swim fairly well. It had been his practice to
swim in a tank. He had swum now and then near
shore, but he had no conception of the amount of
salt water that can get into a man&#8217;s mouth in a
really long push over a sea however slightly broken,
especially if one enters that sea in a sort of bundle,
without taking a proper header. Moreover, the
phenomenon of the tide astonished him; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
imagined in his innocence that the sea also was a
kind of tank and that he had a dead course of it for
the shore, the nearest point of which lay just eastward
of the harbour mouth.</p>

<p>As it was, England seemed to be flitting by at a
terrible rate, and the <i>Lily</i>, when he turned upon his
back and floated for a moment to observe her, had
all the appearance of a ship proceeding at full speed
up Channel, so rapidly did he drift away.</p>

<p>He swam too hurriedly and he exhausted himself,
for his mind was full of terrors: they might fire upon
him&mdash;he did not know what dreadful arsenal the
<i>Lily</i> might not contain!</p>

<p>He remembered having noticed upon the cross-Channel
steamers exceedingly bright little brass
guns, the purpose and use of which had often
troubled him. Now he knew!&mdash;and he hoped
against hope that no such instrument of death
swivelled upon the poop of the <i>Lily</i>.</p>

<p>He dreaded every moment to catch the sharp spit
of flame against the sunlight, a curl of smoke, the
scream of the light shell, the ricochet, the boom
that would come later sullenly upon the air, and
all the rest that he had read of:&mdash;the first shot to
find the range: the dreadful second that would sink
him.</p>

<p>He was relieved, as minute after minute passed,
and no such experiment in marine ballistics was
tried. There was faintly borne to his ears as he
was swept down the ceaseless stream of Ocean, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
little clamour which, on the spot itself, was a roaring
babel; he saw a group of men wrestling with the
davits, but the davits were stiff, and boat-drill was
not in the programme of the <i>Lily</i>. Indeed of all
the crew but two had ever handled such a contrivance
as a davit before, and of these one was an
Italian.</p>

<p>Another man than Captain Higgins would have
been profoundly grateful to see the stowaway drown;
not so that conscientious servant of the Firm. The
stowaway received such food and lodging as had
kept him living until such time as he could be
handed over to the Sheriff or his officers or any
other servants or justices of our lord the King, who
were competent to deal with breach of contract,
tort, replevin and demurrer. The stowaway was
responsible to the Law, and Captain Higgins was
responsible for the stowaway; therefore must a boat
be lowered. And because there was something
grander in swinging out the davits in full view of
a British town and harbour than in chucking the
dinghy into the water, swing out the davits he would,&mdash;and
he lost ten minutes over it&mdash;ten precious
minutes during which the tide had carried the little
speck that was the head of George Mulross Demaine
almost beyond the power of his spyglass.</p>

<p>Captain Higgins capitulated; he left the davits as
they were&mdash;one stuck fast, the other painfully
screwed half round, a deplorable spectacle for the
town of Parham, and one shameful to the reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the sailor-men aboard the <i>Lily</i>, and he ordered
the little dinghy out over the side.</p>

<p>They unlashed her and let her down. Two men
tumbled into her, the second officer took command,
and they rowed away down tide with all the
vigour that Captain Higgins&#8217; awful discipline could
inspire, directed in their course by his repeated
injunctions and proceeding at a pace that must surely
at last overhaul the fugitive.</p>

<p>When Demaine heard the beat of the oars and
again floated to look backwards, he estimated the
distance between himself and the shore and gave
himself up for lost. Now indeed there could be
no doubt of the rope&#8217;s end! He could not disappear
like a whale for any appreciable time beneath the
surface; the tales he had read (and believed) of heroes
in the Napoleonic and other wars, who themselves,
single-handed and in the water, had fought a whole
ship&#8217;s crew with success, he now dismissed as idle
fables. There was nothing left for him but, somewhat
doggedly, to continue the overhand stroke, for
now that he was discovered there was no point in
the slower breast stroke that had helped to conceal
him. They were making (as they said in the days
of the Clippers) perhaps three feet to his one, but
freedom is dear to the human heart, and he pegged
away.</p>

<p>The Shining Goddesses of the Sea loved him more
than they loved the odious denizens of the <i>Lily</i>;
they set the tide in shore, and the Sea Lady, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Silver-Footed One, led the little waves along in his
favour.</p>

<p>He had come to a belt of water where the tide set
inward very rapidly, along a gulley or deep of the
shore water. It was a godsend to him, for his pursuers
were still in the outer tide. He was now not a
quarter of a mile from the water-mark, and still going
strong, with perhaps two hundred yards between
the boat and him; he could not feel their hot breath
upon his neck, but he could hear the rhythmic yell
of the officer astern, criticising the moral characters
of his crew with a regular emphatic cadence that
followed the stroke of the oars ... when his cold,
numbed right foot struck something; then his left
struck sand: ... It was England! And the
English statesman, like Antæus, was glad and was
refreshed.</p>

<p>He stumbled along out of it&mdash;the water on the
shelving sand was here not three feet deep. He
stumbled and raced along through the splashing
water. It fell to his knees, to his shins, to his ankles,
and he was on dry land!</p>

<p>A very pretty problem for the amateur tactician
learned in the matter of landing-parties, was here
presented. The dinghy must ground far out: she
could not be abandoned; it was an even race, and
his pursuers would be one man short from the
necessity of leaving some one in a boat which had
grounded too far out for beaching.</p>

<p>Some such combination occurred in a confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
way to Demaine, but he had no time for following
it up. He did what he had done more than once in
the last unhappy days&mdash;he ran. His numbed feet
suffered agonies upon the shingle above the sand,
but he ran straight inland, he crossed a rough road,
went stumbling over a salted field, and made for a
wind-driven and scraggy spinney that lay some half
a mile inland, defying the sea winds. As he approached
that spinney he saw two men from the
boat just coming full tilt over the ridge of the sea
road; as he plunged into it they were in the midst
of the field beyond.</p>

<p>The undergrowth in the spinney was thick, but
Demaine had the sense to double, and he crept
cautiously but rapidly along, separating the thick
branches as noiselessly as he could, and bearing
heroically with the innumerable brambles that tore
his flesh. He halted a moment to look through
a somewhat thinner place towards the field, and
there, to his considerable astonishment, he perceived
the two sailor-men dawdling along in amicable converse
and apparently taking their time, as though
they were out upon a holiday rather than in the
pursuit of a criminal.</p>

<p>It dawned upon George that there was a reason
for this: the second officer could not leave the boat.
The boat and the sea were hidden by the ridge of
the sea road, and the longer the time the hearty
fellows could spend ashore, the greater their relief
from labour and their enjoyment of a pleasant day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
He saw them sauntering towards the spinney; they
took sticks and beat it in a sort of aimless, perfunctory
manner, poking into the brushwood half-heartedly
here and there, as though Demaine had been a hare
whom they desired to start from its form. They
wandered off along the edge of the wood in a direction
opposite to his own, and paused a moment to light
their pipes upon their way.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful scene: but a moment would
come when that scene could not be prolonged, and
when their activity must be renewed. Demaine,
therefore, pushed through the brushwood, still going
as noiselessly as he could, and came out to the
landward side of it upon a disused lawn.</p>

<p>The grass was brown and rank and trampled. It
had not been mown that season. An old sun-dial
stood in the midst of it; a wall bounded it upon
two sides, and there was the beginning of a gravel
path. He followed that path between two rows of
rusty laurels, and round a sharp turn came upon the
house to which this derelict domain belonged. He
came upon it suddenly.</p>

<p>It stood low and had been masked from him by a
belt of trees. He saw a little back door, and,&mdash;fatal
as had such reasoning been in his immediate past,&mdash;he
reasoned once more: that where there was a house
with servants&#8217; offices, there would be a difference
of social rank, there would be education, there would
be understanding, and he must certainly come into
his own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>His bleeding feet, the soaked rags that clung upon
him, his hair hanging in absurd straight lines clogged
with salt, would, could he have seen them in a
looking-glass, have given him pause. But the exhaustion
of these terrible hours was now upon him;
the heat of the sun was increasing,&mdash;he was under
an absolute necessity for food and repose.</p>

<p>He boldly opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>He found himself in a little room of which this
door was evidently the private communication with
the garden; it was a room that lifted his heart.</p>

<p>To begin with, it was lined everywhere with books,
and though he himself had read perhaps but eighteen
volumes in the whole course of his early manhood,
yet a room lined with books justly suggested to him
cultivation, leisure, and a certain amount of wealth.
A volume was lying with its flyleaf open upon the
table. He saw pasted in it a book-plate in the
modern style, made out in the name of Carolus
Merry Armiger. Mr. Armiger, it seemed, was his
unsuspecting host. Mr. Armiger&#8217;s literary occupations
did not interest George Mulross; such as they
were he gathered them to have some connection
with the Ten Lost Tribes.</p>

<p>Manuscripts were lying upon the table, manuscripts
consisting of long double lists of names with
a date between them. The Jewish Encyclopedia
was ranged in awful solemnity before these manuscripts;
the Court Guides, reference books and
almanacs of London, Berlin, New York, Frankfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Paris, Rome and Vienna, were laid ready to hand, and
sundry slips detailing the family origins and marital
connections of most European statesmen, including
of course our own, completed the work upon which
the chief resident of the house appeared to be
engaged.</p>

<p>Forgetting the deplorable condition in which he
was, a big scarecrow reeking and dripping salt water
from sodden black rags that clung to his nakedness,
George Mulross sank into a large easy-chair and
breathed a sigh of profound content.</p>

<p>They might look as long as they chose, he thought
they would look for him in vain! His pursuers did
not know who he was nor that he had come back
into his own rank of life again and had certainly
found, though they were as yet unknown to him,
equals who would as certainly befriend and protect
him.</p>

<p>He pictured the scene to himself:&mdash;the owner of
the house enters&mdash;he is wearing spectacles, he is a
busy literary man, a professor perhaps&mdash;who could
tell?&mdash;a learned Rabbi! The papers and the books
upon the table seemed to concern the Hebrew race.
At any rate, a literary man&mdash;a solid literary man.
He would come in, preoccupied, as is the manner of
his tribe, he would look fussily for something that he
had mislaid upon the table, his eyes would light upon
the form of George Mulross Demaine. At first sight
he would be surprised. A man partially naked,
glistening in the salt of the sea, his hair falling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
absurd straight wisps clotted with damp, his face a
mixture of grime and white patches where the water
had washed it, his nails a dense black, his bare feet
bleeding, would stand before him. But this strange
figure would speak a word, and all would be well.
He would say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, my name is Demaine. You are perhaps
acquainted with that name. I beg you to listen to
me and I will briefly tell you,&#8221; etc. etc.</p>

<p>The literary man would be profoundly and
increasingly interested as the narrative proceeded,
and at its close a warm bath and refreshment of the
best would be provided, a certain deference even
would appear in his host&#8217;s manner when he had
fully gathered that he was speaking to a Cabinet
Minister, and from that moment the unhappy business
would be no more than an exciting memory.</p>

<p>As George Mulross so mused he rose from his
chair and was horrified to note that there stood in
the hollow of it little pools of salt water, that the
back was dripping wet, and that where his feet had
reposed upon the Axminster carpet damp patches
recalling the discovery of the Man Friday, the marks
of human feet, were clearly apparent.</p>

<p>Even as he noted these things and appreciated
that they would constitute some handicap to his
explanation, he heard voices outside the door.</p>

<p>Alas, they were not the voices of the governing
classes, they were not the voices of refinement and
leisured ease. Oh! no. They were the voices of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
domestics engaged in altercation, the one male, the
other female; and the latter, after affirming that
it was none of her partner&#8217;s business, evidently
approached the door of the room in which he was.</p>

<p>For a moment his heart stopped beating. He
heard her hand upon the outer handle of the door;
by what form of address could he melt that uncultivated
heart? Those bitter hours of his just
passed had filled him with a mixture of terror and
hatred for such English men and women as work for
their living. He had always regarded them as of
another species: he beheld them now in the aspect
of unreasoning wolves.</p>

<p>By the grace of heaven the door was locked. He
heard a female expletive, extreme in tone though
mild in phrase, directed towards the domestic habits
of her master, especially with regard to the privacy of
his study, and he next heard her steps moving away.
She was coming round by the garden; there was not
a moment to lose ... and there was not a cranny
in which to hide.</p>

<p>I have expatiated on the effect of misery and of
terror upon George&#8217;s brain: I have but here to add
that for two seconds he was a veritable Napoleon in
his survey of terrain. He grasped in a flash that if
he retreated by the garden door he was full in the
line of the enemy&#8217;s advance without an alternative
route towards any base; and with such an inspiration
as decided Jena, he made for the chimney.</p>

<p>The eccentricities of the master of the house (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he was obviously eccentric) appeared to include a
passion for old-fashioned fireplaces; at any rate there
was no register nor any other devilish device for
impeding the progress of the human form, and
George, with a dexterity remarkable in one of his
bulk, hoisted himself into the space immediately
above the grate. There the chimney narrowed
rapidly to a small flue, and he must perforce support
himself by the really painful method of pressing with
his feet against the one wall, and with his cramped
shoulders against the other, lying in the attitude of a
man curled up in bed upon his right side,&mdash;but in no
such comfort, for where the bed should be was air.</p>

<p>He had not gained his lair a moment too soon.
He could discover from it the hearth-rug, a small
strip of the carpet, and the legs of sundry tables and
chairs, when he heard the garden door open, and
other legs,&mdash;human legs&mdash;natty, and their extremities
alone visible, passed among the legs of the inanimate
things. The head which owned them far above continued,
as the legs and feet bore it round the room, to
criticise the habits of its master. It dusted, it went
to the farther side of the apartment, the feet disappeared.
They reappeared suddenly within his
line of vision and stopped dead, while the invisible
head remarked in a tone of curiosity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking at the imprint of the feet. Next
he heard her patting the damp arm-chair, and exclaiming
that she never!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>The strain upon George Mulross Demaine was
increasing, but had it been tenfold as severe he
dared not descend. A slight involuntary movement
due to an effort to ease his shoulder off a point of
brick produced a fall of soot which most unpleasantly
covered his face.</p>

<p>He could hear a startled exclamation from the
wench, her decision that she didn&#8217;t understand the
house at all, and her sudden exit.</p>

<p>Hardly had she shut the garden door behind her
when a key was heard turning in the lock in the other
door opening into the house, and the Expected
Stranger, the Unknown Host, entered. The moment
of George&#8217;s salvation was at hand.</p>

<p>Two very large flat boots slowly tramped into the
narrow region he could survey: above each nine
inches of creased grey trouser leg could be seen; the
boots, the trouser legs, did not approach the arm-chair;
they took little notice apparently of things
about them. Their owner grunted his satisfaction
that none of his papers had been removed by the
maid to whom he applied a most indiscreet epithet;
he grunted further satisfaction that she had laid his
fire and not lit it. Apparently it was among his
other eccentricities to have a fire upon a June morning
simply because the room was cold, and to let it die
down before noon.</p>

<p>The Unknown came close to the grate. George
heard large hands fumbling upon the mantelpiece,
the unmistakable rattle of a match-box; next an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
arm midway to the shoulder, and at its extremity
a hand bearing a lighted match appeared, and the
Stranger Host thoughtfully lit the Newspaper upon
which the fire was laid.</p>

<p>The dense and acrid smoke produced by our
Great Organs of Opinion when they are put to this
domestic purpose rose up and enveloped the unhappy
George. It was the limit! And with one cry and
with one roar, as Macaulay finely says of another
crisis, the prospective Warden of the Court of Dowry
slid down into the grate, ruining the careful structure
of coal and wood, and stood in the presence
of&mdash;he could scarcely believe his eyes&mdash;William
Bailey!</p>

<p>That tall, bewhiskered, genial oligarch expressed
no marked astonishment. It is, alas! a characteristic
of the eccentric that, just as he sees the world all
wrong where it is normal, so, before the abnormal he
is incapable of expressing reasonable emotion. All
he said was, in a mild tone of voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! well! well!&#8221;</p>

<p>To which Demaine answered, with the solemnity
the occasion demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;William, don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know you,&#8221; said William Bailey thoughtfully,
&#8220;Dimmy, by God!... Dimmy, d&#8217;you know
that you present a most extraordinary spectacle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me that,&#8221; said Dimmy bitterly,
drawing his hand across his mouth and displaying
two red lips which appeared in the midst of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
features like those of a comedy negro. &#8220;The point
is what can you do for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Dimmy,&#8221; said William Bailey, his
interest increasing as the situation grew upon him,
&#8220;I am delighted to hear that phrase! I haven&#8217;t
heard it since I gave up politics! I haven&#8217;t heard
it since they tried to make me an Under Secretary,&mdash;only
it used to be worded a little differently. Old
schoolfellows of mine whom I had thrashed with a
cricket stump in years gone by used to come up
washing their hands and saying, &#8216;What can I do
for you?&#8217; Now for once in my life some one has
asked me what <i>I</i> can do for <i>him</i>. Sweet Dimmy,
all I have is at your disposal. Would you like
to borrow some money, or would you prefer to
wash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d chuck that sort of thing,&#8221; said
Demaine, angrily and with insufficient respect for a
senior. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t London and I&#8217;m not out for jokes.
I&#8217;m in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In trouble?&#8221; said William Bailey, asking the
question sympathetically. &#8220;Oh don&#8217;t say that!
Dirty, maybe, and very funnily dressed, but not, I
hope, in trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; said the other, &#8220;what are you in this
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am out of it,&#8221; said William Bailey cheerfully,
&#8220;a harmless eccentric with a small property,
several bees in my bonnet (the present one an anti-Semitic
bee), and a great lover of my friends, Dimmy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
especially men of my own blood. Now then, what
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you own this house, or do you not?&#8221; demanded
Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said William Bailey, &#8220;it is very good
of you to ask. I am what the law calls a lessor
or lessee, or perhaps I am a bailee of the
house. The house itself belongs to Merry. You
know Merry, the architect who builds his father&#8217;s
houses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The books have got &#8216;Armiger&#8217; in them,&#8221; said
Dimmy suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a title,&#8221; replied William Bailey, &#8220;not an
English title,&#8221; he continued hurriedly, &#8220;it was given
him by the Pope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, you&#8217;re master here?&#8221; said Demaine
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Bailey, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been master here since
the end of the first week. At first there was some
doubt whether it was Elise or the groom or Parrett,
the housekeeper, who was master. But I won,
Dimmy,&#8221; he said, rubbing his hands contentedly, &#8220;I
brought down my servant Zachary and between us
we won. They&#8217;re as tame as pheasants now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Demaine, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to
do two things. You&#8217;ve got to cleanse me and to
clothe me and to hide me during the next few hours
if the necessity arises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you shouldn&#8217;t cleanse yourself,&#8221;
said William Bailey thoughtfully. &#8220;You&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
never learned a trade, Dimmy, and you were never
handy or quick at things, but you&#8217;re a grown man,
and there&#8217;s lots of hot water and soap and stuff in
the bathroom; there was a beastly thing called a
loofah that Merry had left there, but I&#8217;ve burned it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Bill!&#8221; pleaded Demaine, &#8220;there
isn&#8217;t time, really there isn&#8217;t. Then tell me, what
clothes have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine are too narrow in the shoulders for you,&#8221;
said William Bailey, thinking, &#8220;Zachary is altogether
too thin. You&#8217;re big, Dimmy, not to say fat. The
trousers wouldn&#8217;t meet and the coat wouldn&#8217;t go on.
But I can put you to bed and send for clothes.
What d&#8217;you mean about hiding? I can see you have
some reasons for privacy; in fact if you <i>hadn&#8217;t</i>,
getting up that chimney would be a schoolboy sort
of thing to do at your age. Have you been bathing
without a licence, and some one stolen your clothes?
Or have they been having a jolly rag at the Buteleys&#8217;?
They&#8217;re close by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you when I&#8217;ve washed,&#8221; said Demaine
wearily, &#8220;only now do let me slip up to the bathroom
like a good fellow. Good God, I&#8217;m tired!&#8221;</p>

<p>William Bailey opened the door and peered
cautiously into the corridor, listened for footsteps and
heard none, and then, after locking the door of the
study behind him, as was his ridiculous habit, he
popped up a narrow pair of stairs, with Dimmy,
whose old nature had sufficiently returned to cause
him to stumble, following at his heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>They were not quite out of the range of the front
door when there came a violent pull at the bell, and
Elise went forward to open it.</p>

<p>William Bailey pushed his guest and cousin into
the bathroom and went down to meet two policemen
who stood with awful solemnity, clothed in suspicion
and in power, at his threshold. From the depths of
his sanctuary and through the crack of the half-open
window, Demaine heard a conversation that did not
please him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very sorry to have to ask you sir,&#8221; a deep bass
was saying, &#8220;we&#8217;re bound to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bound to do it,&#8221; echoed a tenor.</p>

<p>Demaine did not hear his cousin&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;s been on the premises, sir?&#8221;
came from the first policeman, whom I will call
&#8220;<i>Basso Profondo</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive,&#8221; answered William Bailey&#8217;s voice, cheerful
and loud. &#8220;Positive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see him with your own eyes, sir?&#8221; this
from the second policeman, whom I will call &#8220;<i>Tenore
Stridente</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I did, or I wouldn&#8217;t be telling you
this,&#8221; came again from William Bailey a little
testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, sir, we&#8217;ve suspicions that he&#8217;s on the
place still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong there,&#8221; said William Bailey, &#8220;he
ran off down the Parham road when he heard my
dog bark.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t meet any one on the Parham road, sir:&#8221;
it was the voice of the Tenore policeman who spoke,
evidently a less ingenuous man than the Basso.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that,&#8221; said William Bailey. &#8220;You&#8217;re
welcome to look over the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thanked him and walked in like an army.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for your own good, sir,&#8221; said the first policeman,
in his deep bass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides which it&#8217;s our duty,&#8221; said the second
policeman in his <i>tenore stridente</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said William Bailey, &#8220;of course, and I
hope that while one of you is doing the good, the
other will look after the duty. It&#8217;s the kind of thing
people like me are very fond of doing, hiding stowaways.
I&#8217;ve hidden bushels of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tenor was indifferent to his sarcasm, the bass
was touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know very well, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what the
criminal classes are, or rather you gentlemen don&#8217;t
know. Why, he&#8217;d cut the women&#8217;s throats in the
night and make off with the valuables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he cut mine?&#8221; asked William Bailey as
he followed them from room to room.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s capable of it,&#8221; said the bass, nodding
mysteriously. &#8220;He&#8217;s not an ordinary stowaway,&#8221; he
continued, lowering his voice almost to a gruff
whisper, &#8220;<i>he&#8217;s well known to the police</i>. He&#8217;s <i>Stappy</i>,
that&#8217;s what he is, <span class="smcap">Stappy the Clinker</span>! He&#8217;s done
this trick before, getting aboard a vessel and pretending
he&#8217;s a vagabun; the Chief knows all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
him! He did a man in last Monday night in
London!&#8221;</p>

<p>To the unhappy man in the bathroom there
returned with vivid horror the recollection of Lewes
Gaol; but so long as William Bailey&#8217;s wits did not
fail him he knew that more than even chances were
in his favour. His mood changed suddenly, however,
when the police, who had been perambulating the
small rooms near his retreat, suddenly rattled the
door of his bathroom and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do beg of you to take care, gentlemen,&#8221; said
William Bailey angrily, &#8220;that&#8217;s the bathroom, and if
you want to know, my niece is inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I beg your pardon,&#8221; said the bass, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
He had the sense not to doubt the master of the
house in a matter directly concerning his own
interest. But the tenor added:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make a note of it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said William Bailey, &#8220;by all
means. Her name is Rebecca.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Mulross Demaine, in the delight of the
very warm water, was soothed to hear them
tramping heavily down the stairs once more.</p>

<p>They examined every room and cranny of the
place until they came to the study door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my study,&#8221; said William Bailey apologetically,
&#8220;I always keep it locked.&#8221;</p>

<p>He unlocked it and they entered. Their trained
eyes could see nothing unusual in the aspect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
room until the tenor inadvertently putting his hand
upon the back of the arm-chair discovered it to be
both wet and to the taste salt. He had found a
clue! In a voice of excitement unworthy of his
office, the intelligent officer shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got &#8217;im sir, we&#8217;ve got &#8217;im! He&#8217;s been
here! Look&mdash;sea water. We&#8217;ve got &#8217;im!&#8221; He
looked round wildly as though expecting to see
the runaway appear suddenly in mid-air between
the floor and the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly most disconcerting,&#8221; said William
Bailey in evident alarm. &#8220;But wait a minute.
Perhaps he came in here from the garden to see
what he could get, found the door locked on the
outside and made out through the garden again;
that would explain everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No it wouldn&#8217;t sir,&#8221; said the bass respectfully, &#8220;it
wouldn&#8217;t explain <i>that</i>!&#8221; And his mind, which, if
slower than his colleague&#8217;s, was prone to sound
conclusions, pointed his hand to the wreck of the
fire, to the heaps of soot that lay upon it, and the
disturbance of the fender.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone up the chimney, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s
done,&#8221; said the tenor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s done,&#8221; said the bass, putting
the matter in his own way, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone up the
chimney.&#8221;</p>

<p>William Bailey put his head in and looked up the
flue, the top of which was a little square of blue
June sunlight above. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see him,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>The constables, one after the other, solemnly
performed the same feat.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man couldn&#8217;t get up that,&#8221; said Bailey
stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, <i>Stappy</i> could,&#8221; said the bass in a tone of
one who talks of an old acquaintance, &#8220;Stappy
could get out of anywhere, or through anything!
He&#8217;s a wonderful man, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the tenor solved the whole business.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on the roof!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Nothing would suit them but ladders must be
brought, and they must climb upon the slates, while
William Bailey, consoling himself with the thought
that the property was not his, took the opportunity
of dashing up to the bathroom and banging at the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy, Dimmy!&#8221; he whispered loudly, &#8220;Dimmy,
get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all wet,&#8221; said Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re used to that,&#8221; said Bailey unfeelingly.
&#8220;Dry your feet. Never mind the rest. Quick!&#8221;
He threw a dressing-gown in, and Dimmy, as clean
as Sunday morning, emerged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are your feet quite dry, Dimmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said that great Commoner, still a trifle
ruffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, let me think.... Go in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed Demaine into a little writing-room that
gave out of the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, go to that little table and sit perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
tight. Do as I tell you and you are saved. Depart-by-but-one-iota-from-my-specific-instructions-and
though you&#8217;ll ultimately be redeemed by your
powerful relatives from the ignominy of incarceration,
you cannot fail to become a laughing-stock before
your fellow-citizens! Do you take me, Dimmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dimmy, who like the rest of the family was never
quite certain whether William Bailey&#8217;s final outbreak
into downright lunacy might not take place at any
moment, suddenly sat where he was bid, and his
cousin returned within thirty seconds bearing a
woman&#8217;s walking-cloak and a respectable bonnet
which, I regret to say, were those of Parrett herself.
Bailey huddled the cloak upon the younger man,
banged the bonnet upon his head, tied the ribbons
under his chin, disposed his person with the back
to the door, in the attitude of one writing a note,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dimmy, could you talk in a high voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try. Say &#8216;Oh don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m busy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Dimmy again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great heavens! is there no limit to the things
you can&#8217;t do?&#8221; said William Bailey testily. &#8220;Try.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a vast sacrifice of that self-respect which was
his chiefest treasure, Dimmy uttered the grotesque
words in a faint falsetto.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said William Bailey. &#8220;Now when
you hear the word &#8216;Rebecca&#8217; that&#8217;s your cue. Say
it again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>The second step is easier than the first, and
Dimmy this time replied at once, the falsetto quite
just: &#8220;Oh don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m busy.&#8221; And William Bailey
was satisfied.</p>

<p>By this time the policemen could be heard scrambling
down from the roof; they had found nothing,
which, seeing that the roof was in shape exactly pyramidical,
was not wonderful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s gone, sir,&#8221; said the bass a little
relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must see the bathroom before we leave,
though,&#8221; added the tenor fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said William Bailey, &#8220;if it&#8217;s
empty,&#8221; he added with a decent reserve.</p>

<p>They went upstairs and on their way he opened
the writing-room door, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there she is. Rebecca!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh don&#8217;t worry me, I&#8217;m busy,&#8221; boomed in a
manly voice from the seated figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I&#8217;m sure sir,&#8221; said the tenor, who was now
sincerely apologetic. &#8220;We have no desire to disturb
the lady, but it was our duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said William Bailey hurriedly, &#8220;of
course,&#8221; and he shut the door, mentally renewing
his profound faith in the imbecility of political life.</p>

<p>The active and intelligent officers of the law gazed
mechanically round the bathroom; they were too
modest to examine a certain damp heap of black
cloth that was flung huddled into a corner. They
went out with every assurance that they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
have disturbed Mr. Bailey for a moment had they
not been compelled by that sense of duty to their
country to which they had already so frequently
alluded.</p>

<p>William Bailey accompanied them to the gate, in
the fixed desire to see them off the place, and with
a heartfelt silent prayer that Parrett would not go
into the writing-room until he had returned.</p>

<p>As they reached the gate the bass, who remembered
the necessity for subscriptions to local clubs, charities
and balls, and especially to the Policemen&#8217;s balls,
charities and clubs, said once more that he hoped
Mr. Bailey understood they had only done their
duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we know Mr. Merry very
well, and we take it you&#8217;re a friend of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said the tenor more severely, &#8220;and we
know who you are. We know everybody in the place,
sir. It&#8217;s our business. We know what they do, where
they come from and where they go to. They can&#8217;t
escape us.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this cheerful assurance the bass and the tenor
both slightly saluted, and the gate shut behind them.</p>

<p>Outside the gate a little crowd consisting of the
two sailor-men, a dingy officer of the mercantile
marine, three young boys, a draggle-tailed village
girl, and a spaniel, awaited the return of the police,
and when it was known that they had drawn blank,
this little crowd paradoxically enough gave cry.
Each was now as certain that he had seen the fugitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in some one of a hundred opposing and impossible
directions as he had formerly been determined that
the refugee was still concealed in Mr. Merry&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>William Bailey hurried back: he went straight to
the writing-room. He thanked heaven that no one
had disturbed Rebecca. Without an apology he
rapidly untied the ribbons of the bonnet, hoicked off
the cloak and was bearing them back to Parrett&#8217;s
room when he heard the voice of that admirable
female raised in hot remonstrance against the misdeeds
of a domestic.</p>

<p>In tactics as in strategy there is a disposition known
as the offensive-defensive. William Bailey was
familiar with it. He adopted it now, and in a voice
that silenced every other sort, he roared his complaint
that the servants perpetually left their clothes hanging
about at random right and left all over the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose is this?&#8221; he demanded, pointing to the
cloak and bonnet where he had flung them sprawling
on a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine, sir,&#8221; said Parrett with considerable
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh it is, is it?&#8221; said Bailey a little mollified.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Parrett. If I&#8217;d known it was yours I&#8217;d
have spoken to you privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never left them there, sir!&#8221; said Parrett all aruffle
with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said you did, I never said you did. It&#8217;s
none of my business. I don&#8217;t care who left them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
there; but I will have this house <i>orderly</i> or I will not
have it at <i>all</i>,&#8221; with which enigmatical sentence for
the further discipline of Merry&#8217;s impossible household,
he went back to Demaine in his dressing-gown and
brought him through the corridor to the study.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now my dear fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are you cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thirsty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very tired,&#8221; said Dimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then, you shall eat and drink. I will
try and light the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so and the room, which was already warm
with the June sun, became like an oven. As he rose
from his chair Demaine said in some anxiety: &#8220;For
heavens&#8217; sake don&#8217;t send for the servants!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to,&#8221; said William Bailey simply.
He went to a cupboard and brought out some ham, a
loaf and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Demaine ate and drank. When he had eaten and
drunk he could hardly support himself for fatigue.</p>

<p>William Bailey took him to his own room and told
him to sleep there. &#8220;I&#8217;ve established,&#8221; he said, in a
genial tone, &#8220;so healthy a reign of terror in this
house that you certainly will not be disturbed if you
sleep in my bed. I will see about the clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus, after so many and so great adventures,
George Mulross Demaine slept once again between
sheets, in a bed well aired, in a room with reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
pictures upon the walls, and reasonable books upon
the table, with blankets, with curtains, with pillows,
with mahogany tallboys, with three kinds of looking-glasses,
with an eider-down quilt, with a deep carpet,
with a silver reading lamp, soothed by a complete
cleanliness, and, in a word, amid all that the governing
classes have very properly secured for themselves
during their short pilgrimage through the wilderness
of this world.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL through that hot noon and down the beginning
of the sun&#8217;s decline, George Mulross
slept heavily; he slept as in a death, in Parham.</p>

<p>He slept in the house of Carolus Merry Armiger,
under the shield and tutelage of William Bailey,
eccentric, and with God&#8217;s benediction upon him.
His troubles were at an end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile in London, the young and popular
Prime Minister had received his secretary&#8217;s report.
The <i>Moon</i> and the <i>Capon</i> were squared.</p>

<p>How squared he was not busy to inquire. Gold
and silver he had none&mdash;for those purposes at
least&mdash;that would not be in the best traditions of
our public life: but they <i>were</i> squared: Edward
assured him they were squared, and there was an
end of it.</p>

<p>There was more even than Edward&#8217;s assurance,
though that was as solid as marble; there were two
early copies of the papers themselves which had been
ordered and brought to him. The leader of the one
dealt with those eternal Concessions in Burma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and he smiled. There was not a word about Repton.
The leader of the other was on Fiddlededee, and the
Prime Minister experienced an immense relief.</p>

<p>But there was still Demaine,&mdash;or rather, there was
still no Demaine. And there was still Repton, mad&mdash;mad&mdash;mad!</p>

<p>Between Dolly and the awful unstable equilibrium
of the modern world, between him and a cosmic
explosion, was nothing but the four walls round
Repton, Lady Repton who bored him, and the
sagacity of Edward. It was a quarter to three, a
time when meaner men must wend them to the
House of Commons. He also wended. He was the
shepherd and he must look after his sheep.</p>

<p>That august assembly was astonished to perceive
the Premier positively present upon the front bench
during the process of that appeal to the Almighty
which precedes the business of the day. But <i>that</i>
did not get into the papers:&mdash;there is a limit!</p>

<p>As he knelt there he knew that a man whom he
could not disobey was about to ask a question of
which he had given private notice. He feared it
much, he more feared those supplementary questions
which are so useless to the scheme of our polity
but which buzz like unnecessary midges round the
cooking of the national food. And when prayers
were over and questions begun, not an inquiry as
to an Admiralty contract, not a simple demand for
information from the Home Secretary as to the
incarceration of a beggar or the torture of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
insignificant pauper, but put his heart into his
mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. Maloney&#8217;s long cross-examination on the
matter of the postmistress at Crosshaurigh gave
him a little breathing space. They couldn&#8217;t bring
Repton or Demaine in on that! But there was
an ominous question about a wreck, and who
should answer it? He had indeed arranged that
the answer should proceed from the Treasury, but
the clouds were lowering.</p>

<p>The question came as mild as milk: it was
concerned with the wreck which still banged and
battered about on the Sovereign Shoals; it had
been put down days before, and the chief legal
adviser of the Crown rose solemnly to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;My right honourable friend has asked me to
answer this question. He has no further information
beyond that which he has already furnished to
the honourable gentleman, but every inquiry is being
made and papers will shortly be laid upon the table
of the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fanatic rose, the inevitable fanatic, towering
from the benches, and thundered his supplementary
demand: What had been done with the gin? He
was told to give notice of the question.</p>

<p>For three dreadful seconds the Prime Minister
feared some consequence. His fears were well
grounded. A gentleman rose and spoke from the
darkness under the gallery and desired to know why
the <i>Warden of the Court of Dowry</i> was not present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to deal with matters concerning his Department?
He would have been reproved by the Chair had not
the young and popular Prime Minister taken it upon
himself to rise and reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the first time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I hope it will
be the last, that I have heard the illness of a colleague
made the excuse for such an interruption.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the benches behind him those who knew the
truth applauded and those who did not applauded
more loudly still.</p>

<p>With what genius had he not saved the situation!
And the questions meandered on, and all was well,
save for that last dreadful query of which he had had
private notice.</p>

<p>It was put at the end of question-time, not, oddly
enough, by the member who most coveted the
apparently vacant Wardenship, nor even by any
relative of that member, nay, not even by a friend:
a member surely innocent of all personal motives put
that question. He desired to know, whether rumours
appearing in the papers upon the Wardenship of the
Court of Dowry were well founded, whether the
Wardenship of the Court of Dowry were not for the
moment vacant, and if so what steps were being
taken to fill that vacancy.</p>

<p>The reply was curt and sufficient: &#8220;The honourable
member must not believe everything he reads in
the newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not often that wit of a lightning kind falls
zigzag and blasts the efforts of anarchy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
National Council. Wit is very properly excluded
from the exercise of legislative power; but when it
appears&mdash;when there is good reason for its appearance&mdash;its
success is overwhelming: and by the
action of this one brilliant phrase, perhaps the
most dangerous crisis through which the Constitution
has passed since the flight of James <small>II.</small> was
triumphantly passed.</p>

<p>Question-time was over. The young and popular
Prime Minister, now wholly oblivious of his left lung,
answered one or two minor questions, gave assurances
as to the order of business, and left the House
a happier man than he had entered it. He went
straight to Downing Street. When he got to his
room Edward was there awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got Demaine,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The luck had turned!</p>

<p>For half a minute Dolly couldn&#8217;t speak: then he
gasped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
anybody knows. There was a telephone message
sent to the Press everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thousand horrid thoughts! Found dead? Found
wandering and imbecile? Found&mdash;&mdash;? He was faster
bound than ever&mdash;and that just in the hour when he
must act and decide. He said again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did it come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward,&#8221; said the Premier faintly, as he sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and fell to pieces, &#8220;you know how to do these
things.... Puff!&mdash; ... Do go like ... a good
fellow&mdash;find out ... quietly ... ch ... <i>where</i> it
came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward went into the next room and called up
009 Central. He was given 1009, kept his temper
and repeated his call. A Being replied to him in an
angry woman&#8217;s voice and begged him not to shout
into the receiver.</p>

<p>He asked for the clerk in charge and waited ten
minutes. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister in his room was not at ease.
His mood was if anything burdened by the delivery
of an express message which ran: &#8220;They&#8217;ve found
Dimmy. M. S.&#8221; The writing was the writing of
Mary Smith. He asked the messenger with some
indifference to find out who had sent the message and
where it had come from.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the absence of Edward, he went into
an outer room and begged them to call up Mrs.
Smith&#8217;s house. When he returned there was a
telegram from Charing Cross upon his table which
ran:</p>

<p>&#8220;George found.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no signature. He waited patiently for
the return of Edward or the messenger or of something&mdash;hang
it all, <i>something</i>!</p>

<p>The little buzzer on his table buzzed gently and
the telephone whispered into his ear that &#8220;Mrs.
Demaine wished him to know that Mr. Demaine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
found.&#8221; He had already asked &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;
when he was cut off.</p>

<p>He had received so much information and no more
when Edward returned with the information that the
news had come in from Trunk Seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is Trunk Seven?&#8221; said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>They sat together for a moment in silence. The
Premier, as befitted his office, was a man of resource.
Outside Westminster Bridge Underground Station
men of insufficient capital but of economic ambition
deal in the retail commerce of news. It occurred to
the Prime Minister to reassure himself from their
posters, and from a room that gave upon Westminster
Bridge Road, his excellent eyesight&mdash;for it was
among his points that his eyesight at fifty-four was
still strong&mdash;perused the placards opposite.</p>

<p>They were clear enough.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;LOST MINISTER FOUND&#8221;</p>

<p>said the most decent.</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;DEMAINE RESULT&#8221;</p>

<p>said the <i>Capon</i>, which appeared to have forgotten its
good manners.</p>

<p>It ought not to be difficult to get the <i>Capon</i>
without loss of dignity. He returned to his room
and in about five minutes the <i>Capon</i> was brought to
him.</p>

<p>Under the heading &#8220;Stop Press News,&#8221; he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
&#8220;Demaine Result,&#8221; and then underneath, more
courteously: &#8220;Mr. Demaine has been heard of.&#8221; It
was printed in faint wobbly type in a big blank
space&mdash;and there was nothing more.</p>

<p>Edward, entering at that moment, told him that
the exact point from which the message had been
sent could not be discovered until Brighton had
cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>He was going to call up Mary Smith, but Edward
assured him that nothing more than an inept
half-wit maid would answer the demand&mdash;he had
tried it.</p>

<p>Dolly sat on in patience and wondered where
Demaine had been discovered. The matter was of
some moment. Without the least doubt he would
have to make up his mind as to the succession of
the office that very afternoon, and it was already
close on five.</p>

<p>Demaine might be discovered suffering from a loss
of memory (though what he had to remember Dolly
couldn&#8217;t conceive); he might have been discovered
in the hands of the police. He might have been
discovered attempting for some unknown reason to
fly the country. Till the Premier knew more he
could not act.</p>

<p>For a good half-hour he persuaded himself that it
was better to wait. Then he went out and motored
to Mary&#8217;s.</p>

<p>And Mary of course was not at home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>He went on to Demaine House, and found there
nothing but a man making a very careful inventory
of all the pictures, all the furniture and all the glass.
He came back to his room, and at last the mystery
was solved.</p>

<p>All good things come to an end, as do all delays
and all vexations, and life itself. By a method less
expeditious than some of those which modern
civilisation has put at our disposal, the full truth
was revealed to him.</p>

<p>George Mulross Demaine was at that moment (it
was six o&#8217;clock) upon that afternoon of Wednesday,
the 3rd of June, ... drinking brandy and soda in
great quantities and refusing tea, at the Liverpool
Street Hotel. A courteous message from the
Manager thereof was the source of the information,
and Edward&mdash;Edward who never failed&mdash;had been
the first to receive it.</p>

<p>The message had gone up and down London
a good deal before it had got to the House of
Commons; at Demaine House the Manager had
been told to try Mary Smith&#8217;s number, and at Mary
Smith&#8217;s the half-wit having almost had her head
blown off by Edward&#8217;s repeated violence, very
sensibly suggested that the Manager should telephone
direct to the House of Commons and give a
body peace.</p>

<p>An instant demand (said Edward) that Demaine
should himself come to the instrument, had been
followed by a very long pause, after which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
told that the gentleman had gone off in a four-wheeler
with a lame horse, and had left the bill
unpaid.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait.</p>

<p>Half-past six struck, and the quarter. Their fears
were renewed when, just upon seven, a figure strangely
but neatly clothed was shown into the room, by a
servant who displayed such an exact proportion
between censure and respect as would have puzzled
the most wearisome of modern dramatists to depict.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was Demaine!</p>

<p>His clothes were indeed extraordinary. You could
not say they fitted, and you could not say they did
not fit. The trousers and the coat and the waistcoat
were made of one cloth, a quiet yellow. The lines
of the shoulders, the arms, the legs, the very stomach,
were right lines: they were lines proceeding from
point to point; they were lines taking the shortest
route from point to point. They were straight: they
were plumb straight. The creases upon the trousers
were not those adumbrations of creases which the
most vulgar of the smart permit to hint at the
newness of their raiment: they were solid ridges
resembling the roofs of new barns or the keels of
racing ships. The lapels of the coat did not sit well
upon it; rather they were glued to it. The waistcoat
did not fit, it stuck. And above this strange
accoutrement shone, with more fitness than Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and Dolly could have imagined, the simple face of
George Mulross Demaine.</p>

<p>His hair&mdash;oh horror!&mdash;was oiled; one might have
sworn that his face was oiled as well.</p>

<p>The colour of his skin resembled cedarwood save
on the nose, where it resembled old oak. If ever a
man was fit, that man was George Mulross, but if
ever a man was changed, George Mulross was also
that man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said the Prime Minister delightedly.
&#8220;Oh my dear George, sit down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said George, using that phrase perhaps
for the twentieth time during the last forty-eight
hours. &#8220;They&#8217;re ready-made,&#8221; he explained, blushing
(as Homer beautifully puts it of Andromache)
through his tan. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t sit down in the train and
I didn&#8217;t sit down in the cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been, George?&#8221; asked the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had an adventure,&#8221; said George modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But hang it all, where have you <i>been</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to sea,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h-h-h-h-h!&#8221; said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly luck, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said George simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than that,&#8221; said Edward grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked George with something like fright
upon his honest if oleaginous face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;It must have
been pretty tough. Were you blown out to sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>George Mulross Demaine&#8217;s only reply was to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
inside his coat for the place where pockets are often
constructed for the well-to-do, but where no pocket
seemed to exist. He made five or six good digs for
it, but it was not there. He looked up huntedly and
said: &#8220;Wait a minute.&#8221; He put his hand into his
waistcoat. There again there was no receptacle,
but that which should have held his watch&mdash;and even
the young idealism of the Prime Minister permitted
him to wonder why no watch was there. Then
George did what I hope no member of the governing
class has ever done before&mdash;he felt in his trousers
pocket, and thence he pulled out a bit of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, concealing the writing from them,
&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right. I <i>was</i> blown out to sea. I had
a&#8221;&mdash;(here he peered closely at the paper and apparently
could not make out a word.) &#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;a terrible time.&#8221; His diction was singularly
monotonous. &#8220;I-thought-I-should-never-have-survived-that-terrible-night.
A-foreign-ship-passed-me-but-the-scoundrels-left-me-to-my-fate.
I-was-nearly-dead-when-under-the-first-rays-of-morning-I-saw-the-British-flag-and-my-heart-leaped-within-me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward, though not usually impetuous, bereft him
of the document, and as he did so the Prime Minister
saw the square firm characters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lord!&#8221; shouted the Premier, &#8220;It&#8217;s Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it <i>was</i> the writing of William Bailey.</p>

<p>&#8220;William&#8217;s been very good to me, if you mean
that,&#8221; said Demaine reproachfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>The Prime Minister burst into the first hearty
laugh he had enjoyed in fifteen years. After all,
men like Bailey were of some use in the world!</p>

<p>In spite of Dimmy&#8217;s obvious choler, with the tears
of laughter in his eyes, and interrupted by little
screams of merriment, the Prime Minister completed
the reading.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, I cried &#8220;A
sail! a sail!&#8221;; and in less time than it takes to read
this, hearty English hands were tugging at the oars.&#8217;
(&#8220;Oh Edward, Edward!&#8221; gasped the exhausted
man, and when he had recovered his breath continued:)
&#8216;With the tenderness almost of a woman
he lifted ...&#8217; (&#8220;Who lifted you?&#8221; he asked between
his shrieks and wagging his forefinger to George
Demaine. &#8220;Oh George, who lifted you?&#8221;) ... &#8216;He
lifted me on board the good ship <i>Lily</i>, and when I
told him of the treacherous action of the foreigners,
muttered &#8220;Scoundrel&#8221; between his teeth. But a man
has naught to fear when the brave hearts of his
countrymen are his shield. They landed me at
Lowestoft, pressing into my hands their petty
savings, and left me with three hearty cheers that
did me almost as much good as to feel my feet once
more upon British soil.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister laid his head upon the table,
wagged it gently from side to side, uttered a series
of incongruous sounds, and very nearly broke
down.</p>

<p>George Mulross Demaine was exceedingly angry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>&#8220;It may seem very funny to you,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, George!&#8221; said the Premier, going off
again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>But George was boiling. &#8220;How would you like
it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began shouting.... When the door
opened and there was announced with extreme
solemnity Mr. Pickle, Mr. Hogge, Mr. Gracechurch,
Mr. Fuell, Mr. Nydd, Sir John Clegg, Lord Cuthbertson,
and last but by no means least, Mr.
Howll....</p>

<p>One would have said that nothing had happened.
There were three doors to the room&mdash;as is proper to
every room in which farces are played.</p>

<p>Through one of these Edward very gently led the
stiff but still burning George.</p>

<p>Through the second appeared an official gentleman
commonly present at interviews of this kind.</p>

<p>Through the third the deputation had entered;
and the young and popular Prime Minister, all
sympathy, all heart, all ears, all teeth, all intelligence,
heard such an indictment of the maladministration
of Spitzbergen by the infamous King of Bohemia as
he had perhaps not listened to more than thirty-eight
times during the course of the last two years.</p>

<p>Edward took George by the arm through room
after room, down a corridor, into a hall, then as
though by magic an excellent motor appeared.</p>

<p>They got in, Edward still making himself perfectly
charming, Dimmy in a constrained attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
stretched tangentially to the edge of the seat, and
the motor drove them for a very great number of
miles, during which journey Edward learned all the
main story; the robbery, the refuge aboard-ship, the
escape, and the fortunate discovery of William Bailey.</p>

<p>George was given to understand with that method
and insistence most proper to his character that <i>that</i>
story had better be forgotten and that only what
he had been given to read,&mdash;and only the gist of
that,&mdash;might very well be published to his wife and
to the world....</p>

<p>It was an understood matter. George did now
and then like to row and fish; a friend had asked
him to run down to Port Victoria&mdash;it was only an
hour; the friend hadn&#8217;t turned up. George only
meant to go out for a minute, put up the sprits&#8217;l
like a fool, got blown right away in front of a
so&#8217;wester into the Swin; then the wind going round
a point-o&#8217;-two got blown, begad, right over the Gunfleet.
High tide luckily, and the rest naturally
followed.</p>

<p>These nautical experiences filled George with
doubts.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any so&#8217;wester,&#8221; he said with bovine
criticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly ass,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;who notices a
thing like that in London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d notice it at sea,&#8221; said George with profound
conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, unless you want a good story against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
you to the end of your life, you&#8217;ve got to be outside
for thirty-six hours, and you&#8217;ve got to land a dam
long way off from Parham,&mdash;I can tell you that!&#8221;
said Edward firmly.</p>

<p>And George agreed.</p>

<p>They dined together at Richmond, which suburban
town they had reached by Edward&#8217;s directions, and
George, replete after so much suffering, became most
genial. He betrayed in his conversation the fact
that Sudie might or might not know the truth; he
had not dared to communicate with her. William
Bailey had done so after getting his new clothes, but
there had been no one at home. There was only
a man in, making an inventory, and the footman
thought the message had something to do with him.
What Sudie might have heard from others he didn&#8217;t
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did the telephone message come from?&#8221;
asked Edward who remembered the torturing anxiety
of his Chief upon that point which now seemed so
futile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; George bleated, if I may use so
disrespectful a term of a man with £100 a week. &#8220;I
really don&#8217;t know. He hired a motor, I know that,
and he drove it himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh he did, did he? Where did he drive it to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a station,&#8221; said George lucidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long way off?&#8221; asked Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; said George, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me. Right
away over all sorts of places.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>&#8220;Now, Demaine, listen,&#8221; said Evans, concentrating
&#8220;Could you see the sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George with a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you see the river,&mdash;anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George. &#8220;We got there at three, and
William telephoned from the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But damn it all!&#8221; cried Edward, &#8220;what was the
name of the station?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward tried another approach. &#8220;Were there
houses round it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, lots,&#8221; said George, &#8220;lots&mdash;and they had
laurels, and there was a lot of gas lamp-posts, and
there was a tramway&mdash;oh it was a beastly place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Evans understood and Kent, the Garden of
England, was in his mind: Kent and one of its deeply
bosomed towns, Chislehurst haply or St. Mary Cray.
&#8220;But why did you go to Liverpool Street when you
got in at Cannon Street?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know I got in at Cannon Street?&#8221;
asked George with wide-open eyes like a child who
sees the secretly marked card come out of the
pack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Why did you go to Liverpool
Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;William told me to,&#8221; answered George simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make a good front benchman,&#8221; said
Edward half to himself. &#8220;Do you know why he
told you to go to Liverpool Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I don&#8217;t.... I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Edward, as though conveying a profound
secret, &#8220;if ever you happen to be at Lowestoft,
that&#8217;s the way you get in to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is it?&#8221; said George blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did he buy your clothes?&#8221; asked Edward
suddenly, &#8220;what shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in Parham somewhere,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know where. I put &#8217;em on before I started of
course. I couldn&#8217;t stay in a dressing-gown.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thought occurred to Edward. He pulled back
the collar of Demaine&#8217;s coat, and saw marked upon a
tape, &#8220;Harrington Brothers, Parham.&#8221; Without so
much as asking his leave he cut the label.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on the shirt?&#8221; he asked laconically.</p>

<p>George opened his waistcoat and looked. &#8220;Six
sixty-six,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the mark of the beast,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you mean?&#8221; said George, bewildered.
&#8220;William Bailey lent it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d told me that,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
have asked you what the mark was; and what&#8217;s more,
if you had told me the mark I could have told you
the owner. Good lord!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;what other
man in England!... Had he hauled his Jewish
Encyclopedia down there?&#8221; he suddenly turned
round to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said George eagerly, &#8220;how did you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh nothing,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;only I know he is
fond of it. Did you eat ham?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said George thinking closely, &#8220;I did. Yes,
I remember distinctly, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression of Edward was completely satisfied.</p>

<p>The time had come for their return. George,
whose carelessness about money had received very
distinct and very severe shocks in the last few
months&mdash;nay, in the last few days&mdash;insisted upon
paying, and Edward, who knew more than was good
for him, allowed him to pay: and further advised
him to spend the morrow, Thursday, in bed.
&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;not where the sharks
can get at you. Wait till Dolly sends, and that&#8217;ll be
Friday, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drove back to Demaine House, and Sudie,
having heard the news from half London, was left to
deal with the truant as she saw fit.</p>

<p>As for Edward, he was back late at night in
Downing Street where bread-and-butter called him.
But he found his chief with the mood of that happy
afternoon long past, for, one encumbrance well discharged,
the other did but the more gravely harass
him, and the memory of Repton, of Repton doing he
knew not what,&mdash;perhaps at that very moment
wrecking any one of twenty political arrangements&mdash;tortured
him beyond bearing.</p>

<p>But as the Premier had justly thought that afternoon,
the tide had turned; and when the tide
turns in the fairway of a harbour, though it turns
here and there with eddies and with doubt, at last
it sets full, and so it was now with the fortunes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
our beloved land and of its twentyfold beloved
Cabinet.</p>

<p>Repton was at that very moment restored to
his right mind&mdash;his Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia were restored to
their normal function&mdash;and would never tell the truth
again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL night Sir Charles Repton had tossed in an
uneasy slumber; all night his faithful wife
Maria had sat up watching him. She dared not trust
a trained nurse; she dared not trust a single member
of the household, for he muttered as he slept strange
things concerning the governance of England, and
stranger things concerning his own financial schemes.</p>

<p>At one moment, it was about half-past four in the
morning,&mdash;much at the time when Demaine, seventy
miles away, upon the bosom of the ocean, had woken
to see the sun&mdash;his predecessor in the Wardenship of
the Court of Dowry (and still the titular holder of
that office) had started suddenly up in bed, and
violently denounced a man with an Austrian name as
having cheated him by obtaining prior information
upon the Budget. He asked rapidly in his mania
why Consols had gone up in the first week of April,
and would not be pacified until his wife, with the tact
that is born of affection, had assumed the rôle of the
unpleasing foreigner and had confessed all. Then
and then only was he pacified and fell into the first
true sleep he had enjoyed for twenty-four hours. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
slept until eleven, and she, brave woman that she was,
snatched some little sleep at his side, but only upon
the edge of sleep as it were, waking at any moment
to shield him from the consequences of his disease.</p>

<p>When he woke she herself made it her duty to go
downstairs and fetch him his breakfast, but though
his repose had recruited his body, his dear mind was
still unhinged.</p>

<p>He would have it that the Royal Family when they
invested in some concern were not registered under
their true names, and he began a long wild rambling
harangue about the death duties and some new story
about yet another outlandish name, and the insufficiency
of the taxes for which it was responsible.
The whole thing was described in a manner so
clear and sensible as added to the horror of the
contrast between his sanity and that other dreadful
mood.</p>

<p>By noon, still lying in his bed, he was contrasting
to her wearied ear the cost of the Tubes in London
as against those in Paris, and making jokes about
&#8220;boring through the London clay.&#8221; He went on to
ask why a friend of his had drawn his salary as a
Minister for some little time after his death, and
suddenly went off at a tangent upon the noble
self-sacrifice of Lord Axton in exiling himself to a
tropic clime, threatening that unfortunate peer with
certain bankruptcy and possible imprisonment unless
a report upon the Bitsu Marsh were favourable.
Then for a blessed half-hour he was silent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>At the end of it he called for a pen and paper, and
wrote a number of short notes. Luckily he gave
them to her to be posted; she read but a few, and
with trembling hands she burned them all, even the
stamps, though she knew how particular he had been
in the old days on that detail.</p>

<p>He dressed and came down. She persuaded him&mdash;oh
how lovingly,&mdash;to sit in his favourite room
overlooking the Park. She forgot that it overlooked
the crowded throng, and from close upon one until
late in the afternoon this devoted angel clung to him
while he poured out meaningless denunciations of all
his world, up hill and down dale, relieved from time
to time (a relief to him but not to her) by a sudden
throwing up of the window, and an address to the
passers-by.</p>

<p>He warned more than one omnibus as it passed, of
an approaching combine between the various lines,
and urged the shareholders to buy while yet there
was time. At one awful moment he had begun
excitedly to point out the figure of a Bishop upon the
opposite pavement and to begin a full biography of
that hierarch, when she thought it her duty to slam
down the window and to bear the weight of his anger
rather than permit the scene.</p>

<p>Small knots of people gathered outside the house,
but the police had been warned and they were
easily dispersed, with no necessity for violence beyond
the loss of a tooth or two on the part of the
crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>As though her task were not enough, the house was
full of the noise of bells, message after message
calling for news and for information, but she had
already given orders to the secretary to write out
whatever commonplace messages might occur to him,
and he faithfully performed his duty.</p>

<p>In her confusion she could see no issue but to try
yet another night&#8217;s sleep, and when he carried his
hand to his head as he now and then did, when the
touch of pain stung him, she comforted herself with
this assurance, that a paroxysm of such violence
could not long endure.</p>

<p>I say a paroxysm of such violence, though there
was nothing violent in the man&#8217;s demeanour: the
horror lay in the cold contrast between the pleasant
easy tone in which the things were said and the
things that were said in that pleasant easy tone, while
the violence was no more than the violence of contrast
between his absurd affirmations and the quiet current
of the national life.</p>

<p>The printing of one-tenth of those simple, easily
delivered words might have ruined the country. We
owe it to Lady Repton&mdash;and I trust it will never be
forgotten&mdash;that no syllable of them all was printed,
and that the greater part of them were not even heard
by any other ear than her own.</p>

<p>She had persuaded him to an early dinner; she
had even put it at the amazing hour of half-past
seven. She had ordered such food as she knew he
best loved, and the wine that soothed him most&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
happened to be a Norman champagne. She
was particular to request a full service of attendance,
for her experience told her that in such surroundings
he was ever at his best.</p>

<p>Another attack of pain in the head seized him and
passed. She sat doggedly, and endured. This
admirable wife after her day-long watch was
exhausted and heart-sick. She saw no issue anywhere.
She sat by her husband&#8217;s side, starting
nervously at the least sound from below, and
listening to his impossible commentaries upon
contemporary life, his hair-raising stories of his
friends, his colleagues and even of her own religious
pastors, and his bouts of self-revelations, or rather let
us hope, of diseased imaginings, when there was put
into her hand an express letter.</p>

<p>The superscription was peculiar; it ran:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gapright">To the Rt. Hon.</span><br />
<span class="gapright">To the</span><br />
<span class="gap2">The Lady C. Repton, M.V.O.</span></p>

<p>She opened it in wonderment. Its contents were far
simpler than its exterior: they ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;Your husband&#8217;s case noted as per
enclosed cutting. I know what is wrong with him
and I can cure him. My price is five hundred dollars
($500.00) one hundred pounds (£100). The operation
is warranted not to take more than ten minutes of his
valuable time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>&#8220;Will call upon you when you are through tea
and he is quite rested, somewheres round eight o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Yrs. etc., &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Scipio Knickerbocker</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></div>

<p>Caught in the fold of this short note was a newspaper
paragraph and a card printed in gold letters upon
imitation ivory:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Scipio Knickerbocker, M.D.</span><br />
415 Tenth St.<br />
<span class="gap2">London, Ont.</span><br />

<span class="gap4">And the Savoy Hotel.</span></p>

<p>Had she been alone she would have prayed for
guidance.</p>

<p>Eight o&#8217;clock, of all hours! And what was
&#8220;Ont.&#8221;?</p>

<p>Drowning women catch at straws. Under no
other conceivable circumstances would Lady Repton
have caught at such a wretched straw as this. But
the faculty had deserted her, she had no remedy; she
saw, she knew, everybody knew, that her husband
was mad; she divined from twenty indications and
especially from the suddenness of the pain, that
the madness was some simple case of mechanical
pressure. And suppose this man really knew how
to cure him? She dared not ask her husband to put
yet earlier the hour of his meal, at which he had
already grumbled; beside which, it was too late.
The incomprehensible Scipio would arrive.</p>

<p>She was still in an agony of doubt when she
accompanied her husband (who as he went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the stairs and entered the dining-room was chatting
gaily upon the amours of a prominent member of
the Opposition) and as their lonely meal proceeded
in the presence of those great over-dressed mutes,
their servants, to all her other anxieties was added
her irresolution upon the prime question, whether
she should or should not accept the desperate
aid of an utterly unknown man, perhaps an
adventurer.</p>

<p>Just as Sir Charles had finished his soup, and
with it his amusing little story about the Baronetcy
which though it had been paid for by the son and
heir (who was solvent) came out after all in the
Birthday List as a Knighthood,&mdash;just as he had
finished his soup I say, he gave a loud cry and put
both hands to his head just behind the ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crickey how it hurts, William!&#8221; he remarked to
the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles,&#8221; said the butler in the tone of
a hierarch at his devotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone now,&#8221; said the Baronet, with a sigh of
relief, &#8220;but it <i>does</i> hurt when it comes! What&#8217;s the
fish?&#8221; and he continued his meal.</p>

<p>He drank a great gulp of wine and was better....
&#8220;It&#8217;s dry,&#8221; he said doubtfully, &#8220;it&#8217;s too dry ...
but there are advantages to <i>that</i>. You know why
they make wine dry, William?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you do, do you? You&#8217;re getting too smart.
You couldn&#8217;t tell me, I&#8217;ll bet brazils!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&#8220;No, Sir Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Repton with a merry wink, &#8220;it&#8217;s to
save your mouth next morning!&#8221; Then up went
his hands to his head again and he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your head hurting you again, darling?&#8221; said
Lady Repton when she saw the gesture repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, damnably,&#8221; said Sir Charles in a loud tone.
&#8220;It&#8217;s hurting just under both ears, just where Sambo
gave ... ah! that&#8217;s better ... (a gasp) ... gave
the Tomtit that nasty one in the big fight I went
to see last week&mdash;the night I telephoned home to
say that I was kept at the House,&#8221; he added by
way of explanation.</p>

<p>The servants stood around like posts, and Lady
Repton endured her agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think what I should have enjoyed most,&#8221; mused
Sir Charles after this revelation, &#8220;would have been
to run across old Prout just as I came out of that
Club. Not that he knows anything about such
things, but still, it was a pretty lousy place. Besides
which, the people I was with! It would have been
fun to see old Prout sit up. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if
he&#8217;d refused to let me speak at the Parson&#8217;s Show
after that; and in <i>that</i> case,&#8221; ended Sir Charles
significantly tapping his trousers pocket, &#8220;there&#8217;d
be an end to the wherewith!&#8221; He nodded genially
to his wife. &#8220;There&#8217;d be a drying up of the needful!
Wouldn&#8217;t there, William?&#8221; he suddenly demanded
of the gorgeous domestic, who was at that moment
pouring him out some wine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles,&#8221; said the hireling in a tone
of the deepest respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what keeps &#8217;em going, my dear,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and here&#8217;s to you,&#8221; he added, lifting his glass.
&#8220;Are you put out about something?&#8221; he said, with
real kindness in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, it&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; said that really
Christian woman, nearly bursting into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really very sorry if I&#8217;ve hurt your feelings in
any way, my dear,&#8221; said Charles Repton.</p>

<p>No symptom of his malady was more distressing
than this unmanly softness, it was so utterly different
from his daily habit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never dream of wounding her ladyship intentionally;
would I, William?&#8221; he asked again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir Charles,&#8221; said William.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better go upstairs, dear,&#8221; said the
unfortunate lady. &#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; she sighed as a
sudden peal rang through the house, and then subsiding,
she said: &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s only a bell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her ladyship&#8217;s nervous to-night, William,&#8221; said
Repton as one man should to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir Charles,&#8221; repeated William in a grave
monotone.</p>

<p>A card was brought in upon a salver of enormous
dimensions and of remarkable if hideous workmanship.</p>

<p>Lady Repton recognised the name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go out a moment. I&#8217;ll be back in a
moment, Charles.&#8221; She looked at him with a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of anxiety and affection, and left him chatting gaily
to the servant.</p>

<p>Scipio Knickerbocker stood without.</p>

<p>Any doubts upon the matter were settled not only
by his appearance but by his first phrase which ran
in a singular intonation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady <i>C.</i> Repton? I am Scipio Knickerbocker,
M.D. (Phillipsville), Ma&#8217;am,&#8221;&mdash;and he bowed. He
was an exceedingly small man; he wore very long
hair beautifully parted in the middle; his jaw was so
square, deep and thrust forward as to be a positive
malformation, but to convey at the same time an
impression of indomitable will, not to say mulish
obstinacy. His arms and legs were evidently too
thin for health, and the development of his chest was
deplorable. He was dressed in exceedingly good
grey cloth, but his collar, oddly enough, was of
celluloid. His buttoned boots were of patent leather,
his tie had been tied once and for ever, and sewed
into the shape it bore. He carried in his left hand
an ominous little black leather bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into this room,&#8221; said Lady Repton hurriedly.
She took him into a small room next to the dining-room,
and communicating with it by a little door;
she switched on the electric light and stood while she
asked him breathlessly what credentials he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the physician in a metallic staccato,
&#8220;I hev no credentials. What I propose to-night will
be my sole credential.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the silence before her reply, Sir Charles&#8217; merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
monologue, occasionally broken by the grave assent
of the butler, could be heard in the next room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say you can do?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, let me first tell <i>you</i> right now what
the Senator&#8217;s gotten wrawng with him. In nineteen
fourteen, month of September, I could not hev told
you; but in nineteen fourteen, month of October,
I could: fur your distinguished British physicist
<i>and</i> biologist, Henry Upton, then pro-mulgated his
eppoch-making discovery. You hev hurd tell of
Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lady Repton nervously, and in a
quavering voice, &#8220;I have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the Imperial authority with perfect
composure, &#8220;I hev them here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dived into his bag and produced a little card
on which was perfectly indicated the back of the
human head, only with the skin and hair removed;
two lumps on either side of the neck of this diagram
bore in large red letters, &#8220;Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia,&#8221; and two
white lines leading from them bore in smaller
type, &#8220;Caryll&#8217;s Ducts.&#8221;</p>

<p>This card he gravely put into her hands. She
looked at it with some disgust: it reminded her of
visits to the butchers&#8217; during the impecuniosity of
her early married life.</p>

<p>When, as the Son of Empire fondly imagined,
his hostess had thoroughly grasped the main lines
of cerebral anatomy, he suddenly thrust his hand
into the bag again and pulled out a little pamphlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
which, as it is carefully printed at the end of this
book and as the reader will most certainly skip it, I
shall not inflict upon her in this place.</p>

<p>It was a reproduction, in portable form, of the
great lecture delivered in the January of that year
at the Royal Institute. It set forth the late Henry
Upton&#8217;s discovery that Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia were the seat
of self-restraint and due caution in the Human Brain.</p>

<p>The poor woman was too bewildered to make
head or tail of it, and whether the reader give herself
the pains to peruse it or no is indifferent, for
its contents in no way affect this powerful and
moving tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; he said when she lifted her eyes from
it and as he fondly imagined had mastered its details,&mdash;&#8220;you
do not perhaps see the con-nection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face assured him that she did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; he added grandiloquently, &#8220;did the
world, until I perceived that if indeed such functions
attached to Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia, why the least obstruction
of their ducts would condemn the sufferer to
occasional violent pain accompanied by such inability
to refrain from expression as must ruin his career
and ultimately make a wreck of his bodily frame.
Madame, cases of such obstruction I hev found to
hev occurred in the ducts. Madame, <i>I</i> discovered
by what slight touch of the lancet the tiny <i>im</i>pediment
could be instantly removed. Madame,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;the Caryll&#8217;s ducts in Sir Charles&#8217; head
are ob-structed, hence the recurrent pain and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
lamentable attack of <small>VERACITITIS</small> from which he
in-dub-it-ab-ly suffers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Velossy what?&#8221; gasped Lady Repton.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Veracititis</i>, Ma&#8217;am. The phrase is my own; for
it is I who have identified the relation between the
ganglia and the distressing symptoms you have
observed. He stands before you, <i>he</i> does. Madame,
it is already enshrined in the proofs of the Columbia
Encyclopedia&#8221;&mdash;he dived once more into his bag
and handed her yet another paper&mdash;&#8220;as <i>Veracititis
Knickerbockeriensis</i>. In Ontario since Washington&#8217;s
Birthday, we hev hed three cases; I was called over
privately a month ago for a most distressing case,
luckily suppressed&mdash;never hurd of, Madame, outside
the family. I hev operated with success. Ma&#8217;am, I
can operate with success upon your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a loud scream of pain from the
next room, followed by a gasp of relief and the
expletive &#8220;Great Cæsar&#8217;s Ghost!&#8221; almost decided
Sir Charles&#8217; faithful spouse. Another scream that
proved the spasms to be increasing in violence quite
decided her. She hurriedly re-entered the dining-room,
found Sir Charles white with the severity of
the suffering, and took him gently by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have a practitioner who
can relieve this. He is waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; sighed Sir Charles, as the pain left him, &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to hear it, profoundly glad. They&#8217;re all such
scoundrels, Maria, ... but if he&#8217;s a surgeon and can
cut something out, I&#8217;ll trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be as bad as that,&#8221; said Maria, tenderly
helping the Baronet out through the small door
towards the inner room.</p>

<p>Hardly had he set his eyes on the little doctor
when he burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a ridiculous little ass, Maria!&#8221; he said at
the top of his voice. &#8220;Good lord, what a little
rat!&#8221;</p>

<p>If proof were wanted of the truth of Scipio&#8217;s
contention, his demeanour at this painful moment
was sufficient. It was plainly evident to Lady
Repton&#8217;s not insufficient dose of intellect that no
man would have stood firm who had not seen the
ghastly disease in its worst forms before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sir Charles, &#8220;so you&#8217;re going to cut
me up, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! <i>My</i> no!&#8221; said Scipio. &#8220;Lady Repton
would never hev permitted a serious operation without
your full con-currence. My proposition, Senator, is
nawthing but two slight pricks in the neighbourhood
of the pain. Ye&#8217;ll hardly feel it, but it&#8217;ll change
ye,&#8221; added the determined Knickerbocker with a
suspicion of a smile upon his bony jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;What with?&#8221; said Sir Charles a little nervously.
(&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; by way of digression as there was a stab
of pain.) &#8220;Yes, anything, s&#8217;long as you can do it
quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t take but a moment,&#8221; said Scipio. &#8220;But
there&#8217;d better be some one hold your hands. There&#8217;s
no pain worth accountin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>&#8220;Might we re-quest the Senator to be seated?&#8221;
he politely suggested to the lady.</p>

<p>Sir Charles as politely commented: &#8220;I&#8217;m not a
Senator, you skimpy little fool! Good lord, Maria,
where do people like that come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he chatted thus, Scipio passed one firm hard
skeleton hand over the top of that great brain, and
with the other, even as Sir Charles, with his chin bent
upon his chest, was occupied in explaining to Maria
the physical deficiencies of his medical attendant,
he put the edge of the lancet in the precise position
behind the ear which his science had discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his beastly Yankee accent, if it isn&#8217;t that
beastlier thing, the Australian,&#8221; the great Imperialist
was in the act of saying when the lancet struck
suddenly and was as suddenly withdrawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right, monkey,&#8221; said Sir Charles in
a weaker voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s only a prick, and I think&#8221;&mdash;his
voice still sinking,&mdash;&#8220;that it&#8217;s only due to your
great position in the medical world that I should
express my heartfelt thanks for your courteous
services. It is men like you, sir, who mean to
suffering humanity....&#8221; Sir Charles suddenly
stopped. His voice grew a little louder. &#8220;Did you
say he was a Yankee or an Australian, Maria?
Australians have the Cockney &#8216;a&#8217;; a filthy thing it
is, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>The skeleton hand was poised again upon Sir
Charles&#8217; head; he felt his chin pressed down upon
his chest; there was another sharp little stroke, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
time behind his left ear, and with a deep sigh he
seemed to sink into himself.</p>

<p>Scipio quietly touched the delicate point of his
instrument with antiseptic wool, put it back into
its case and watched his patient with a professional
eye.</p>

<p>The man was dazed. He gripped his wife&#8217;s hand
until he almost caused her pain, and they could
hear him mutter disconnected words:</p>

<p>&#8220;The highest possible appreciation.... My
public position alone ... sufficient reward ... in
its way a link between ... provinces ...
our great Empire ... daughter ... daughter ...
daughter....&#8221; Then almost inaudibly &#8220;... <small>nations</small>.&#8221;</p>

<p>For perhaps five minutes the Great Statesman
was silent, and his breathing was so regular that he
might have been asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he go to sleep, doctor?&#8221; whispered Lady
Repton.</p>

<p>Scipio Knickerbocker shook his head. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be
less rattled every minute, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; was his pronouncement,
and once again he proved his science
by the justice of his prognostication.</p>

<p>Sir Charles stood up, a little groggy, leant one
hand on the back of a chair, took a deep breath,
stood up more strongly, and said at last in a voice
still weak but quite clear:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you sir. How can I thank you? I seem
to remember&#8221;&mdash;he passed his hand over his forehead&mdash;&#8220;I
seem to remember some one telling me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that you were born,&mdash;though I assure you it is
impossible for us in England to distinguish it,&mdash;in
one of our Britains Overseas. Sir, an action such as
that which you have just done&mdash;a good deed if I
may call it so,&#8221; he went on more loudly, seizing
Scipio&#8217;s right hand between both of his, &#8220;is a
cement of Empire! I will never forget it, never!
Will you excuse me a moment sir, while I speak to
Lady Repton?&#8221;</p>

<p>With his best and most winning smile Sir Charles
asked this question of Scipio, who for the tenth or
eleventh time that evening, bowed with a kink in
the fourteenth vertebra.</p>

<p>He drew his wife into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he wants payment on the spot, doesn&#8217;t
he, Maria? These specialists usually do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes dear,&#8221; said Lady Repton, her old awe
returning with his changed mood. &#8220;Yes dear, I&#8217;m
afraid he does ... he ... in fact, I&#8217;m afraid I
promised it him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; said Sir Charles sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well dear, it doesn&#8217;t matter, does it? I&#8217;ll
pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does matter. It matters a great deal,
Maria. It all comes out of <i>my</i> pocket in the long
run. How much did he stipulate for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred pounds,&#8221; said Lady Repton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh come,&#8221; said Sir Charles, greatly relieved.
&#8220;A hundred! That&#8217;s a good lot. How often will
he come for that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>&#8220;He won&#8217;t want to come again, dear,&#8221; said Lady
Repton.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Sir Charles, &#8220;a hundred pounds
for that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&mdash;if you knew the difference!&#8221; said
Lady Repton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know,&#8221; he said impatiently, &#8220;the
pain&#8217;s gone. It can&#8217;t be helped, and of course
ninety&#8217;s a broken sum. He&#8217;d have taken fifty,
Maria. I ought to have seen to this myself,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>And so, the matter settled, he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll allow me to leave you one moment with
her ladyship,&#8221; he said in his most winning manner.
Then suddenly, &#8220;<i>Good</i>-night,&#8221; and with a warm grasp
of the hand Sir Charles left them.</p>

<p>Lady Repton was moved beyond words. She
put into the young man&#8217;s hand a packet of notes
which she had carefully prepared. &#8220;It is nothing,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;it is nothing for what you have done, but
oh, doctor, will it last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll last for ever&mdash;at least,&#8221; he corrected himself
hurriedly, &#8220;they&#8217;ve all lasted so fur, and it&#8217;s more&#8217;n
a year since I did the first. It isn&#8217;t the <i>kind</i> er
thing that comes on again. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t a growth.&#8221; He
was almost going to say what it was, when he
remembered that he held the monopoly. Then,
lest he should stay too long in that house where
he was, after all, but a paid instrument, he very
courteously bade her good-night, and as he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
home, carrying his little bag, Scipio reflected
that he liked Maria, Lady Repton, better than he
did her husband. But he remembered that operations
for Veracititis were, of their nature, causes for
grievous disillusion.</p>

<p>He put the matter from his mind and took a cab
back to his hotel and to bed.</p>

<p>Thus was Sir Charles Repton cured of Veracititis,
late upon Wednesday night, the 3rd of June, 1915,
and he slept his old sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was Friday morning, the 5th of June, 1915,
and the young and popular Prime Minister
was busied in the Inaugural Ceremony of the
Wardenship of the Court of Dowry.</p>

<p>Repton or no Repton, the place must be filled.
Demaine was back and Demaine must be there
on the front bench before there was an explosion.</p>

<p>The Inaugural Ceremony which introduces a
Statesman to the Wardenship of the Court of
Dowry, technically called &#8220;L&#8217;Acceptance,&#8221; in strict
constitutional practice requires the presence of at
least three persons, the outgoing Warden (technically
the Dischargee), the incoming Warden (technically
the Discoverer) and the Sovereign; but since
GHERKIN had, in spite of his eccentric
Radicalism, raised the office to its present position,
the outgoing Warden could be represented by
proxy, though such a substitution was rarely made
since it eliminated the quaint custom of the &#8220;Braise&#8221;&mdash;one
hundred pounds one hundred shillings one
hundred pence, and a new brass farthing specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
minted for the occasion, the whole in a silver-gilt
case, and handed over to the outgoer, to be regarded
with historic respect and some one of its coins to
be kept as an heirloom.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But Dolly, as he considered the situation on the
Friday morning, Friday the 5th of June, 1915, could
see no way out of it; he must simply tell Lady
Repton briefly, and best by telephone, that she
must not dream of her husband&#8217;s appearing at Court,
even with a keeper, and that it would be necessary
for the Repton household to forego the hundred
sovereigns, the hundred shillings, the hundred pence
and the new brass farthing specially minted for the
occasion (the whole in a silver-gilt case), rather than
have a scandal.</p>

<p>It was Friday, and he was glad to remember it, a
Private Members&#8217; Day. There were no questions.
There was all Saturday and Sunday before him.
He would arrange for the Inauguration the very
next week. He was already advised that the
officials had been permitted by the highest authority,
in view of Demaine&#8217;s recent privations when he was
blown out to sea in the little boat, treacherously
abandoned by the foreign vessel and rescued by
the willing hands, etc., to omit the final accolade
with the ebony cudgel which had now for so many
generations formed the last and most picturesque
feature of the ritual.</p>

<p>He took up his telephone and asked the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
room to put him on to the Reptons. He held the
receiver while a servant told him that his message
should be immediately communicated, and then in
a few seconds, heard, to his great astonishment, not
the tremulous tones of Maria, but the masterly voice
of Sir Charles, as incisive and direct as of old,
saying, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; in the tone of a man who
must come at once to business and has many things
to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Dolly into the machine, quite taken
aback. &#8220;That&#8217;s you, Repton, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; came the answer shortly.
&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh nothing. Are you feeling better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221; This in
restrained, quite unmistakable tones. &#8220;My headache&#8217;s
gone, if that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, wondering
what on earth to say. &#8220;Yes.... Oh it&#8217;s gone,
has it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes it has; I&#8217;ve told you that already.&#8221; Then
after a pause, &#8220;Look here, I&#8217;m really very busy. I&#8217;ve
got three men here about that absurd concession.
You gave me a free hand, and I can&#8217;t wait. Hope
I&#8217;m not rude. It&#8217;s really very kind to ask after my
health. You&#8217;ll be in the House at twelve?&#8221; And
the telephone suddenly rang off.</p>

<p>Dolly was in a stupor; he did what he always did,
when things perplexed him: he sent for Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that cracked Dissenter has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
got three men in his house and is talking about the
oil concession to them! Oh lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was evidently frightened and
troubled, but he did not seem less frightened and
more troubled than the occasion warranted. He
couldn&#8217;t make Repton out: there seemed to be
another change.</p>

<p>Edward answered simply: &#8220;Why that makes
three more who know,&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do get a taxi,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, &#8220;and see
what you can do.&#8221; And he waited anxiously till
Edward returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Dolly as he entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t very polite,
but&mdash;but&mdash;are you quite sure that you weren&#8217;t worried
when you saw him on Tuesday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worried,&#8221; said Dolly, &#8220;I should think I was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s what I mean,&#8221; said Edward a little
uneasily. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ... didn&#8217;t you perhaps
exaggerate a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Exaggerate!</i>&#8221; said Dolly, jumping up with all
his youthful vigour, and looking for the moment
less than forty-eight in his excitement, &#8220;Why man
alive, he was wearing a huge great Easter Lily in his
buttonhole, and he tried to wrestle with the butler
in the hall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you know,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;there&#8217;s gaiety
in everybody, and it comes out now and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh gaiety be blasted!&#8221; interrupted Dolly. &#8220;The
man was raving!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;Well, they wouldn&#8217;t certify him anyhow,&#8221; said
Edward, &#8220;and he&#8217;s not raving <i>now</i>! He&#8217;s as sane
as a waxen image, and as sharp as an unexpected
pin. I&#8217;m glad <i>I&#8217;m</i> not doing business with him to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; protested the Prime Minister. &#8220;If
he wasn&#8217;t off, why did he stay at home like a prisoner
all Wednesday, with Lady Repton preventing any one
seeing him? And what was he doing all yesterday,
Thursday? Why didn&#8217;t he come down to the House,
eh, if he wasn&#8217;t off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say he wasn&#8217;t ill,&#8221; said Edward blandly.
&#8220;I only said there might have been some exaggeration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh very well,&#8221; ended the Prime Minister wearily,
&#8220;oh very well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward came to a swift decision and telephoned
first to the <i>Moon</i> then to the <i>Capon</i> privately that
&#8220;it was all right about Repton; there&#8217;d been a
mistake.&#8221; His chief went out on the duties of the
day.</p>

<p>Yet <i>another</i> change of plan! More bother! He
would have to go through with the peerage now!
He went gloomily down to the House of Commons
and learned that Charles Repton was already in his
place, stiff, groomed and regular upon the Treasury
bench.</p>

<p>Dolly came in nervously and shook hands with
him.</p>

<p>Sir Charles took his hand rather coldly; he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
not see why a couple of days&#8217; headache which no one
had heard about should be made the excuse for so
much public affection. It emphasised the thing.
And he sat through the first hour of the debate
looking as if he would have been just as well pleased
to be made less fuss about. &#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; he thought
to himself by way of consolation, &#8220;I shall be rid of
it next week,&#8221; and his mind turned in an equable
fashion to his taking his seat in the Upper House and
to what his first business there might be.</p>

<p>As he was so thinking George Mulross Demaine
came in quietly by one of the side doors. As he
entered there was a little subdued cheering from those
who remembered the announcement of his approaching
appointment. It flurried him a little. He sat
down and tried to forget it, while the debate
maundered on.</p>

<p>In the Lobbies Repton continued to suffer somewhat
from occasional congratulations on his return to
health. He did not easily understand them, and he
was a trifle gruff in his replies. He was going into
the library for a little peace when a messenger put
a note into his hand; it was from the Duke of
Battersea.</p>

<p>&#8220;More fuss!&#8221; he thought, but he went immediately
with his stiff, upright gait to where that great
Financier was waiting for him, and he greeted him
warmly enough.</p>

<p>The Duke, like the business man he was, was very
brief and to the point. He congratulated Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Repton not (thank heaven!) on having got rid of the
slight headache which seemed to have filled the
thoughts of too many people, but upon the great
accession the Upper House was to receive, and then
the Duke having said so much went on to what he
really had to say, his pronunciation marred only
by that slight lisp which ill-natured reports so constantly
exaggerated. Sir Charles Repton (he said)
would remember the very disgraceful case of the
editor of the <i>Islington Hebdomadal Review</i>?</p>

<p>Charles Repton tried to remember, but could not.</p>

<p>Well, it wath the cathe of the man who had very
properly got twenty yearth of the betht for thaying
that he could reveal how old Ballymulrock had got
his peerage ... a dithgratheful cathe! There wath
blackmail behind it!</p>

<p>Yes, Charles Repton could remember now, and he
smiled a grim smile as he considered the peculiar
ineptitude of that particular convict. Why old
Ballymulrock was the seventh in the title, he had
nothing a year, he was a doddering old bachelor of
eighty-seven, he had got it by a fluke from a half-nephew,
and it was only an Irish elective peerage at
that! The convict had pleaded a misprint! What
a fool! Yes, Sir Charles Repton could remember
the case. What about it?   &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to take
any action to save him,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;if that&#8217;s
what you want: he deserved all he got! If you
want some one get Birdwhistlethorpe; Isaacs that
was: he knows North London.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>&#8220;Noh, noh, noh,&#8221; said the aged Duke of Battersea
in alarm, &#8220;you mithunderthand me!&#8221; And he
went on to tell the outgoing Warden that they
were determined to bring this sort of thing before
the House of Lords in a Resolution. Would he
move?</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what I&#8217;ve got to do with it,&#8221; said
Repton shortly.</p>

<p>The Duke smiled as he had smiled years ago,
when he produced Lord Benthorpe&#8217;s paper and
brought that now forgotten personage to heel. Had
Sir Charles seen what the <i>Moon</i> had been saying
that very day?</p>

<p>No, Sir Charles hadn&#8217;t. He supposed it was
about the oil concessions. He paid no attention
to the <i>Moon</i>. But Edward&#8217;s telephone to the <i>Moon</i>
and the <i>Capon</i> had borne dreadful fruit. Each editor
had thought to have regained his freedom.</p>

<p>The Duke of Battersea&#8217;s smile grew more portentous;
he discovered a cutting in the inner pocket
of a coat which somehow or other always looked
greasy upon him, and as Sir Charles read it, his
face darkened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty scandalous,&#8221; he said as he laid it
down. For the leader in the <i>Moon</i> gave it to be
understood in no very roundabout way that there
had been a deal over Repton&#8217;s peerage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Capon&#8217;th</i> worth, <i>far</i> worth!&#8221; insinuated the
Duke of Battersea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; said Sir Charles, &#8220;indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>&#8220;Yeth, indeed yeth,&#8221; said the aged Duke, putting
the paper forward as though over a counter; and
Sir Charles Repton could not forbear to read it.
It certainly <i>was</i> worse; it simply said point blank
that the Burmah Oil Concession was the price of
Repton&#8217;s promotion to the Upper House. And the
passage ended with these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We have no desire to add to a domestic affliction
which no friend of the Government regrets more
sincerely than we do ourselves, and we are willing
to believe that the unfortunate gentleman, who we
fear can never again take his old place in public
life, was himself quite innocent of any such dealing;
but ambitions other than his own may have been
concerned in this matter, and the giving of permanent
legislative power to a man who now
notoriously can no longer take part in active public
life, does but add to the scandal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>That decided him! He would nip off that headache
legend at once, and sharply!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll move as soon as you like,
and the sooner the better.&#8221; He did not say it as
though he was granting a favour; and it was
easy to see that the Duke was a little afraid of
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a pause during which the two men rose
to part, the old gentleman suggested that Methlinghamhurst
should speak after him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>&#8220;Messlingham <i>who</i>?&#8221; said Repton, puzzled. The
name was unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not Methlinghamhurtht! <i>Meth</i>linghamhurtht,&#8221;
said the Duke of Battersea, rather too
loud. &#8220;<i>Meth</i>linghamhurtht!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Charles shook his head, still puzzled. &#8220;I
daresay he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said all starch.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> know,&#8221; said the Duke of Battersea, craning
forward in a confidential way, &#8220;Clutterbuck that
wath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Clutterbuck! Yes, I remember. Well?
Can he speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very well,&#8221; hesitated the Duke of Battersea,
&#8220;but you know he wanted....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Sir Charles moving
away. &#8220;Anyhow I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke was profuse in his thanks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charles Repton returned to the House of
Commons. Another message!</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister begged to see Sir Charles
Repton:&#8221; really there was no end to the number
of people wanting to see him that day! Charles
Repton went towards Dolly&#8217;s room with such
muscles showing upon his face as would have made
any one afraid to say another word about the headache,&mdash;but
it was not of the headache, at least not
of that directly, that Dolly had to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Repton,&#8221; he said apologetically and in some
dread, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I made arrangements for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
proxy next week&mdash;I mean for L&#8217;Acceptance you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you did!&#8221; said Sir Charles, really nettled.
&#8220;You might have asked me first I think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; began his unfortunate chief,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a fact I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Repton drily, &#8220;but
I suppose you&#8217;ve put it right. I&#8217;ve written to say I
should be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, certainly, certainly,&#8221; said Dolly hurriedly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve changed it.&#8221; As a fact he&#8217;d done nothing of
the kind and was wondering what he should say
to the proxy. &#8220;Certainly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Charles Repton moving towards
the door. &#8220;That&#8217;s all, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Dolly, with perhaps a
hundred more things to say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that you get
notice of the exact hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Charles Repton briefly, and he
shut the door quietly but firmly behind him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inaugural ceremony, though shorn for some
years of the backward entrance which was its most
picturesque feature, and now (though not as a precedent)
of the accost with the ebony cudgel, was
impressive enough. The silver-gilt case with the
Three Hundred and One specially minted Coins had
been put into Charles Repton&#8217;s Seisin by the Symbol
of the Flask of Palm Oil, and was already on its way
to his house; the tinkling shoes had been rapidly put
on and off, and Demaine had sworn fealty for sergeanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in Ponthieu and the Seniory of Lucq, and all the
embroglio was done.</p>

<p>Lord Repton (for he was content with that simple
title&mdash;in the Manor of Giggleswick) was present for
the first time upon the red benches, awaiting the
moment for the debate upon the Resolution in which
he was to open and move.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons George Mulross
Demaine, who for the last few days had been coaching
steadily in the duties of his post, and especially in the
really difficult technicalities of replying to questions,
was reading his notes for the last time in the comfortable
room assigned to his office, and repeating to
himself in a low tone the words he had so carefully
committed to memory. Edward was with him to
give him courage; and he needed such companionship.</p>

<p>At last he was summoned.</p>

<p>The House was very full for question-time, for it
was known or suspected that something of importance
would take place that day. The full nature of the
crisis had been understood by very few, but the disappearance
of Demaine and his return, his terrible
adventures in the fishing-boat, his night at sea, the
dastardly action of the foreign crew, and the heroic
succour which had ultimately reached him were public
property.</p>

<p>The silent and little known young member whose
disappearance from the benches under the gallery
would never have been noticed, was half a hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
already in the popular mind, and had become
particularly dear to his colleagues during the anxious
moments when he was believed to be lost, and when
the press of London had worked that mystery for all
it was worth.</p>

<p>The House of Commons knows a <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, loud and hearty cheering,
which, according to the beautiful tradition of our
public life, was confined to no one part of the assembly,
when, that happy Friday, George Mulross entered
rapidly from behind the Speaker&#8217;s chair, stumbled
over the outstretched foot of the Admiralty, his second
uncle by marriage, and took his seat for the first time
among his new colleagues upon the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister accompanied him. Congratulations
suitable to the occasion were to be seen
in the gestures of those in his immediate neighbourhood,
and he himself wore the blest but sickly smile
of a man who is about to be hanged but who is
possessed of a fixed faith in a happy eternity.</p>

<p>Only one question was set down to him; he had
read it and re-read it; he had read and re-read the
typewritten answer which Mr. Sorrel had furnished
him and which he had now got by heart beyond, he
hoped, the possibility of error. The questioner had
chivalrously offered to withdraw his query in deference
to the fatigues and anxieties through which the
new Warden of the Court of Dowry had so recently
passed, but the Prime Minister, though appreciative of
that offer, rather determined that his dear young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
relative should win his spurs; and trivial as the
subject was, Question No. 31 was by far the most
important upon the paper for most of those present.</p>

<p>It concerned (of course) the wreck which still
banged about, the sport of wind and wave, upon
the Royal Sovereign Shoals. This aching tooth of
Empire had cropped up again in yet another aspect.
The Member for Harrowell, a landowner upon that
coast, wanted to know whether it was not a fact that
large planks studded, he was ashamed to say, with
long rusty nails, had not drifted shorewards from the
wreck and grievously scratched such persons as were
indulging in mixed bathing just off the popular and
rapidly rising seaside resort which lay a little east by
north of the wretched derelict.</p>

<p>Question No. 29 was answered, Question 30 was
answered. Demaine&#8217;s ordeal had come.</p>

<p>He heard a low mumbling noise some distance
down the benches which he would never have taken
to be the single word &#8220;Thirty-one&#8221; had not his
mother&#8217;s half-sister&#8217;s husband the Chancellor of the
Exchequer given him a sharp dig in the ribs with his
elbow and jolted him onto his feet. His hands shook
like a motor car at rest as he began his reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to tell my right honourable
gentleman&mdash;I mean my honourable gentleman....&#8221;
Here there was a pause, painful to all present with the
exception of one ribald fellow who cackled twice and
then was silent.... &#8220;I have nothing to add,&#8221; George
Mulross began again with a lump in his throat, &#8220;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
reply to my honourable friend&mdash;to what my predecessor
said in reply to a similar&#8221; (another pause)
... &#8220;Oh,&mdash;<i>question</i>&mdash;upon the tenth of this month.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had read all of it out now, anyhow, and he sat
down, a trifle unsteadily, feeling for the seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arre we to onderrstand,&#8221; boomed the voice of the
inevitable fanatic, &#8220;that the carrgo of GIN is yet
aboorrd...?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! what?&#8221; said Demaine over his shoulder,
with a startled air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up and ask for notice,&#8221; whispered a colleague
very hurriedly. &#8220;Get up and say &#8216;I must ask for
notice of that question.&#8217; Say &#8216;I must ask for notice
of that question.&#8217; Get up quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demaine got up, took hold of the box, turned his
back upon the questioner and looking full at the
harmless and startled Opposition said, not without
menace:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask for a notice of that question&#8221;&mdash;and
sat down.</p>

<p>There were a few more sympathetic cheers and
all was well. The Warden of the Court of Dowry
was launched upon his great career.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, beyond the Central Hall, Lord Repton
of Giggleswick was rising for the first time among
his Peers.</p>

<p>That House also was full and was prepared to
give the spare towering figure and the stoical face
a sympathetic hearing, for the recognition of a man
who had served his country so faithfully and so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and who had recently suffered a temporary malady
of so distressing a nature was universal and sincere.</p>

<p>The House of Lords knows a <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Repton, even as plain Sir Charles, had always
been an admirable parliamentary speaker: not only
quick at debate but with a grave and lucid delivery
which, coupled with his intimate grasp of detail and
the sense of balanced judgment behind his tone,
made his one of the most effective voices in our
public life.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say by what art he contrived
to give in that large assembly the impression of
speaking as quietly as though he were in a private
room, and yet so managed that every word of his&mdash;every
syllable,&mdash;was heard in every corner of the
House.</p>

<p>In the Peeresses&#8217; Gallery women in mauve, heliotrope,
eau-de-nil, crapaud mort, and magenta, made
a brilliant scheme of colour.</p>

<p>The Lords, who upon occasions of privilege are by
custom robed, gave to the splendid place the deeper
tone of red plush and white pelts with small black
tails which is otherwise reserved for such great
occasions of state as the Opening of Parliament, the
Coronation, an Impeachment or a Replevin at Large;
at the bar a crowd of Commoners pressed, many of
whom recognised in the faces before them those of
brothers, fathers, first cousins, debtors, creditors and
clients in business. It was an animated and an
impressive scene, and the audience, large as it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
would doubtless have been larger but for an unfortunate
blunder by which the Eton and Harrow match
and a particularly interesting rehearsal of the Mizraim
dance were both fixed for that very afternoon.</p>

<p>As it was, the two hundred or more Peers present
were finely representative of all that is best and
worst in the national life. The aged Duke of
Battersea had made a point not only of coming but
of speaking upon such an occasion; the Bishops had
turned up in full force, and the Colonial Peers, now
happily added to the ancient House, were remarkable
not only for their strict attention to this historic
business, but for their somewhat constrained attitudes:
not one was absent from his seat.</p>

<p>The report of a speech, however excellent, is but
a dull reflection of the original, as all may judge who
consider the contrast between the entrancing rhetoric
which daily holds spellbound the House of Commons
and the plain prose appearing in the morning
papers.</p>

<p>It would ill repay the reader for the courtesy and
charm she has shown throughout the perusal of these
pages, were I to inflict upon her a mere verbatim
transcript of Lord Repton&#8217;s famous harangue. But
the gist of it well merits record here, not only because
it did much to kill a poisonous spirit which had till
then been growing in English journalism&mdash;but also
because it was in itself a typical and splendid monument
of the things that build up the soul of a
great man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>He began in the simplest manner with a review of
what had determined some of them to bring forward
this Resolution. It needed no reiteration upon his
part, and indeed the matter was so painful that
the mere recalling of it must be made as brief as
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been suggested that places in that House
are acquired by process of purchase.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, in plain English, is the accusation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would remark in passing that the cowards and
slanderers&mdash;he did not hesitate to use strong language&mdash;(and
even the sanctity of the precincts could not
check a murmur of approval), the cowards and
slanderers who brought forward that general accusation,
dared not make it particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;In one case,&#8221; he said, turning gravely to the place
where he expected to see but was disappointed not
to see the very aged frame of Lord Ballymulrock,
&#8220;in one case which referred to a peer whose health I
am distressed to say has made it impossible for him
to be present upon this occasion&#8221; (a protest from an
exceedingly old man who sat folded up on high&mdash;it
was Bally himself!), &#8220;in one case a direct accusation
has been made.... Melords, you know the issue.
An appeal still lies, and it is not for me to deal with
a matter which is <i>sub judice</i>; but apart from that
case, these anonymous hacks who have for so long
corrupted or attempted to corrupt the public mind
in respect to this House, confine themselves to
generalities upon which the law can take no hold.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>It was upon this very account that the general
resolution of which he had spoken had been framed,
and he would pass at once from the unsavoury
recollection of such acts, to that part of his argument
which he thought would have most weight with his
fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>&#8220;This House, including the more recent creations,
the Colonial Peers, and the ex-officio additions with
which a recent&mdash;and in my opinion a beneficent
reform&mdash;has recruited it, still numbers less than
fifteen hundred men. Of these the ex-officio members,
the lords spiritual&#8221; (and he bowed to the Bishop of
Shoreham, who was deaf) &#8220;the elected members from
the Britains Overseas (among whom I am glad to
see present the Nerbuddah Yah) between them
account for no less than forty-two. Two hundred
and eighty&#8221; (he quoted from a paper in his hand) &#8220;are
imbeciles, minors or permanent invalids; somewhat
over fifty are for one reason or another incapacitated
from attendance at their debates; ten are in
gaol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Melords,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;of the eleven
hundred remaining&mdash;they are roughly eleven
hundred,&mdash;what do we find? We find&#8221;&mdash;emphatically
striking his right-hand fist into his left-hand
palm,&mdash;&#8220;we find no less than five hundred and
twelve to be the sons of their fathers&mdash;or in some
other way direct heirs: ninety-eight to have
succeeded to their titles from collaterals of the first
or of the second degree; sixteen to have succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in some more distant manner; eleven to owe their
position to the revival of ancient tenures; the claims
of six to have been recently proved through the
female line; and one by Warranty and Novel
Disseizin. What remains?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked round the eager assembly before him
with an attitude of the head dignified but wonderfully
impressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melords, I ask again, what remains? <i>Less than
four hundred men</i>, the representatives of all the chief
energies of our national life. We have here the
great champions of industry, the great admirals of
our fleets, the great generals of our armies&mdash;and
I am happy to include the Salvation Army, (the
head of that great organisation lifted his biretta)&mdash;men
who have distinguished themselves in every
conceivable path of public life, who have loyally
served their country and many of whom after such
service are still honourably poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this phrase which was evidently the approach
to his peroration, many Peers who had hitherto been
sitting with their knees apart, crossed one leg over
the other; some few who, on the contrary, had had
their legs crossed, uncrossed them and reposed both
feet upon the floor; more than one took the
opportunity to recline his head upon his right hand,
and the most venerable member of the bench of
Bishops coughed in a manner that would have wrung
a heart of stone.</p>

<p>When these slight interruptions were over, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Repton of Giggleswick found it possible to proceed.
He showed by a strict process of inquiry how those
to whom the abominable suggestion might conceivably
apply, could not by any stretch of the
imagination amount to eighty in number.</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than eighty men, Melords, in an assembly
of fifteen hundred! Hardly five per cent.&mdash;hardly,
if I may use a bold metaphor, thirteen pence in the
pound! It is by this proportion alone, even did
these detestable falsehoods contain&mdash;which they do
not&mdash;a grain of truth, that our whole body is forsooth
to be judged! But, Melords, who are these eighty
men, if I do not insult them by permitting my
argument to approach their names?</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not cite my own case; my public career is
open for any man to examine, and I think I know
the temper of my own people too well to delay upon
that score. But there are around me others perhaps
(I know not) more sensitive, or less experienced in
the petty villainies of the world, than am I, who
may have thought themselves especially marked
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask, against which of them could such an
accusation be levelled by name, without the certitude
of such a result in any Court of Justice as would
silence the mouth of the libeller for many years?
Is it, Melords, the man to whom we owe the great
reservoir at Sing Yan? Is it that world-famous
Englishman who by his organising ability, his
untiring industry and his knowledge of men, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
built up the United Sausage Company&#8217;s emporiums
throughout the length and breadth of the land?</p>

<p>&#8220;I might extend the list indefinitely: Melords, to
no one of these, to no one member of this House
I venture to say, can words of this kind be addressed
without their falsity being apparent almost without
need for proof.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat in the words of Burke, &#8216;No, no, no, a
thousand times no.&#8217; I am not ashamed to recall
the glorious phrase with which these walls echoed
to the voice of Ephraim ten years ago: &#8216;Give me such
principles as these and I will trample them into the
dust beneath my feet!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Having said so much, Lord Repton sat down, and
it is a tribute to the fire and the conviction of the
man that a young heiress of African Origin but
recently married, who had been listening intently
from the Peeresses&#8217; Gallery throughout the latter
part of the speech, gave a low moan and fainted clean
away.</p>

<p>Her young form was borne down to the buttery
by a strong posse of attendants where the air from
the Terrace soon revived her. I mention the incident
only as a signal proof of the oratorical powers that
had illumined Repton&#8217;s great career.</p>

<p>After such an effort Lord Methlinghamhurst
necessarily somewhat palled, especially as an imperfection
in his diction, failing eyesight and a certain
loss of memory compelled him to make long and
uncomfortable pauses over the large printed slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
which he held in his hand, but it was over at last,
and the Duke of Battersea rose amid the evident
interest of such as remained to hear him, no less than
five of whom were concerned with himself in the
Anapootra Ruby Mines.</p>

<p>The great financier did well to interpose upon
such an occasion. His lisp, with which the House
was now familiar, was the only impediment to a
sincere and vigorous piece of English. There was
not a word which the most exuberant would presume
to add, nor one which the most fastidious would
dare to erase.</p>

<p>The proceedings had occupied something close
upon three-quarters of an hour, and the Senate,
unused to such delays, was impatient to pass to the
vote, when, to the universal horror of that hall,
Ballymulrock tottered to his feet. There was almost
a stampede. Luckily the Aged Man was as brief
as he was inaudible. It was a couple of squeaks,
several mutters, and a collapse. They proceeded
to put the question.</p>

<p>The Peers flocked back again to their places in
great numbers; others stood ready for the Lobbies&mdash;but
there was no need.</p>

<p>It was one of those rare moments when many
hundreds of hearts, to quote a wild and lovely poem,
beat as one; and with a silent unanimity which eye-witnesses
declare to have formed the most impressive
sight since the first great review of Specials upon
Salisbury Plain, the Resolution was adopted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>Thus was destroyed, let us hope for ever, what was
rapidly growing to be a formidable legend and one
that would have undermined the security of the
State and the honour of our public life in the eyes of
rival nations.</p>

<p>It was not the least of the services which Charles
Repton had rendered to the State, and as we raise
our grateful hats to Providence for the recovery that
made his action possible, let us not forget the genius
of the Young Canadian Doctor who was the author of
that miraculous moment in a story of a thousand years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Private Members&#8217; time was ended. The
House sat on upon the Broadening of the Streets
Bill, the intense unpopularity of which rendered it
especially urgent.</p>

<p>When the House of Commons rose, near midnight,
Dolly and Dimmy went out together by the door of
the private rooms into the cool air and there in the
courtyard were the glowing lamps of Mary&#8217;s motor car.
She beckoned them and they got in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got to come to supper to-night,&#8221; she said
mysteriously. &#8220;They&#8217;ll all be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dimmy was agreeable. Dolly tried to plead something
but she shut him up, and after them in single
file raced through London half a dozen taxis and cars
and broughams all making in a stream for St. James&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It made such a supper-party as Mary Smith alone
in London could gather!</p>

<p>Her sister-in-law, with the Leader of the Opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and his brother; his right-hand man who had been
Chancellor in the last administration; his nephew,
the Postmaster General; Dolly himself; Dolly&#8217;s
brother-in-law, the Secretary for India; his little
nephew&#8217;s wife&#8217;s cousin at the Board of Trade, and his
stepmother&#8217;s brother at the Admiralty, sat down,&mdash;and
so did Dimmy, who was there without his wife,
and also, I regret to say, without a stud, or rather
without the head of a stud, in his shirt; for somehow
it had broken off.</p>

<p>But the reader will have but an imperfect picture
of that jolly table if she imagines that it was a mere
family party.</p>

<p>Our public life is a larger thing than that! Of
the five members of the two front benches who
were not connected by marriage, two were present:
the Minister for Education who could draw such
screamingly funny things on blotting-paper, and
Beagle, back two days before from Berlin, who could
imitate a motor car with his mouth better than any
man in Europe. And there also, by a sort of licence,
was the Duke of Battersea, brought by Charlie
Fitzgerald and his wife.</p>

<p>They had already sat down when William Bailey,
whom no one had invited, came ponderously and
good-humouredly in, affected to stare at the Duke,
and made a place for himself as far as possible from
that controller of hemispheres, who was in his usual
chair on Mary Smith&#8217;s right hand, with bulbous
baggy eyes for none but her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>William Bailey smiled all that evening and smiled
especially at Dimmy&mdash;but he remained very silent;
when, a little before two, they began to make a move,
he had not said a dozen words&mdash;and Dimmy was
exceedingly grateful.</p>

<p>Nay, his friendship extended further: he saw
Demaine as they all got up from table nervously
stuffing a corner of the cloth in mistake for his
handkerchief into his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Dimmy!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Dimmy jumped, and the tablecloth jumped with
him, and then a crash&mdash;a great crash of broken glass,
and the falling of candles.</p>

<p>Mary Smith was very nearly annoyed, but on such
an occasion she forgave him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>North of the Park, for now two hours, Lord Repton
of Giggleswick had slept an easy sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract</span> from a lecture delivered, for a grossly
insufficient fee, by a professor of great popular
reputation at the Royal Institution on January
26th, 1915:&mdash;</p></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Review of Comparative Biology</i> in its October
issue contained a short and modest paper over the
name of Henry Upton which is destined to influence
modern thought more profoundly than anything that
has appeared since <i>Lux Mundi</i> or the <i>Origin of
Species</i>. Henry Upton has been taken from us.
Or, to use a phrase consecrated by his own reverent
quotation of it, he has &#8216;Passed beyond the Veil,&#8217; he
has crossed the bar; but short as the time is since
this brief essay was given to the world, his name is
already famous.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>&#8220;You will have heard the echoes of passionate
discussions upon his famous theory; it is my business
this afternoon to put before you in clear and popular
language that you can easily understand, what that
theory was; and when I have done so I make no
doubt that you will see why it has been thought so
transcendently important.</p>

<p>&#8220;Briefly, Henry Upton declared himself finally
convinced that between Man and the Simius Gabiensis
there existed a differentiation so marked as to destroy
all possibility of any recent common origin for the
two species.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I add that Simius Gabiensis is but the
technical name for the Ringtailed Baboon of our
childhood you will at once appreciate what a revolution
such a pronouncement must work if it can be
sustained: and it has been sustained!</p>

<p>&#8220;It is common knowledge and will be familiar to
the youngest child in this room that the Ringtailed
Baboon is the highest of the Anthropoids, and the
one nearest approaching the majesty of the Human
Species&mdash;Homo Sapiens; and if between him and ourselves
the link of affinity prove far removed, it seems
indeed as though the whole edifice of modern biology
and of modern thought itself will fall to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;The superficial differences to be discovered
between a cleanly and well-bred gentleman and the
Ringtailed Baboon are common property: the beard
in the Anthropoid is not so clearly defined as in the
allied organism of Man, but covers the whole face;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the superciliary arch is more prominent, the diaphragm
tessarated and refulgent, while the Cardiac
Aneries are at once paler and less vasculate in form:
the rings upon the tail are of course peculiar to the
Simian, and almost universally absent in the human
species, while the speech of the latter is far more
complex and articulate than that of the former.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I need not detain this cultured audience with
considerations quite unworthy of physical science.
All the weight of real evidence pointed to the close
relationship between the two types, and it was a
commonplace of the classroom that in all fundamentals
the two animals betrayed an ancestor less
remote than that of the dog and the wolf. Now,
since Henry Upton&#8217;s work appeared, we are certain
that that ancestor is more remote than the ancestor
of the hippopotamus and the Jersey cow, and
probably more remote than that of the mongoose
and the Great Auk.</p>

<p>&#8220;In every text-book we read (and we believed the
statement) that between a really poor man and the
highest specimens of our race lay a gulf wider than
that which separated the former from the Ringtailed
Baboon and even from the Gorilla and the Barbary
Ape. To-day all that is gone!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let me turn to the evidence. Briefly, again,
Henry Upton proved that CARYLL&#8217;S GANGLIA
were not, as had been imagined, unimportant or
useless organs, but were organically necessary to the
full conduct of man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>&#8220;It had of course been known since Caryll first
described and mapped these ganglia, that they were
present in Man and absent in all other animals. But
they were not unique in this, and the obscure part
which they seemed to play in our economy attracted
little attention from the student. Suddenly these
humble agglutinations of organic matter were lifted
into the blaze of fame by an Englishman whose
name will not perish so long as our civilisation
endures. For Henry Upton showed that in these
ganglia lay the capital distinction between man and
his congener; if I, myself, for instance, differ in any
way from &#8216;Pongo&#8217; in Regent&#8217;s Park, it is to Caryll&#8217;s
Ganglia, under Providence, that I owe the privilege.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry Upton was not the man to proceed upon
<i>a priori</i> reasoning, or to state as a conclusion what
was still a bare hypothesis. He had suspected the
truth ten years before committing it to print: they
were ten years of anxiety, nay, of agony, during
which a bolder or less scrupulous man might snatch
from him the merit of prior discovery; but he felt it
was his duty to Science to continue the vast labour
and the patient research, until he could speak once
and for all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upton tabulated in all the enormous number of
57,752 recorded experiments. He first noted the
comparative sizes of the ganglia, in children and
adults, in women and in men, showing them to be
larger in men than in women, and in children rudimentary
before the seventh year. He next proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
that in certain professions, notably in those of the
money-lender, the solicitor and the politician, hypertrophy
of the ganglia was to be discovered. The
conclusions to which this pointed will soon be
evident. His theory already began to take shape.
Luckily for English science, this great man was
possessed of private means. He organised a staff of
enthusiastic young workers who occupied themselves
in treading upon the toes of people in omnibuses,
sitting upon top hats, asking direct questions of slight
acquaintances concerning their financial affairs, and
coughing violently and with long, uninterrupted
spasms at the most exciting moments of melodramatic
plays. The result was in each case
tabulated, and in over 5·08 per cent. of the cases it
was possible with care to discover the position of
the ganglia in those who responded to the stimuli.
Without a single exception the importance of the
ganglia varied directly with the self-restraint exercised
against such stimuli. Those who struck out,
swore, or in any other way betrayed immediate
violence, were found to possess small and sometimes
partially atrophied C. G&#8217;s. Those who protested
sullenly or confined themselves to angry glances
were normal; those who contained themselves as
though nothing had happened, invariably possessed
ganglia of a large and peculiarly healthy type, while
those who actually expressed enjoyment and begged
for a repetition of the performance had ganglia of so
astonishing a size as to cause protuberances on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
side of the head, for Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia lie (as most of
you probably know) a little south-east and by east of
the Aural Cavity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might by this time have seemed sufficiently
proved that Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia were the seat of all
that restraint and balance upon which human
society depends; but Upton was not satisfied
until he had clinched the process of proof by a
negative experiment upon animals:&mdash;And here let
me point out in passing that had certain well-meaning
fanatics their own way, this great revelation
would never have been made. The horse, the
pig, the common house-fly, the bee, the dog and the
wild goose, to give but a few examples, were severally
tested, and in each case it was discovered that a
clout, a fillip, or any other simple stimulus was at
once responded to. In no case was a trace of
Caryll&#8217;s Ganglia to be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;You all know the end!</p>

<p>&#8220;The essay was printed, Upton&#8217;s name had already
flown to the utmost corners of the globe, when he
read in some obscure narrative of travel that the
little armadillo that can sleep without a pillow,
though possessing no ganglia, was capable of the
same balance and restraint as man, could control
himself under all but the most violent stimuli,
conceal his most poignant necessities, and smile in
the presence of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upton was a Scientist of the Scientists. One
single exception and he would retract from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
position. He sailed for the Amazon, interviewed the
armadillo, but at the first pin he thrust into the
fleshy portion of the animal&#8217;s steaks, a little below
the armoured belt, it belied the false report by
turning savagely round and biting off his head. His
remains were reverently brought home to London.
He lies in Westminster Abbey, the last and perhaps
the greatest of martyrs to scientific truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Henry Upton&#8217;s immortal achievement seems
for a moment to have broken down the very keystone
in the arch of social progress, and to have
made null the whole structure of biological truth; if
it leaves Man no longer propped up by a knowledge
of cousinship and brotherhood with the beasts of the
field, but all alone, an exile upon earth, nevertheless
we must take courage. The Bishop of Shoreham
has told us (Etc., etc., etc.).&#8221;</p>
